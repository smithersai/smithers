/**
 * Fails when a workspace manifest and `bun.lock` disagree about a dependency.
 *
 * The repository requires a manifest change to refresh both lockfiles, but
 * nothing enforced it: every CI job installs with pnpm, so `pnpm-lock.yaml` is
 * proved by `--frozen-lockfile` on every run while `bun.lock` is never read.
 * Bun still runs `apps/*`, the `ci/legacy declaration` matrix, and `evals/agent`, so a
 * stale entry there resolves a real package at the wrong version, and it does
 * so only on the Bun surfaces. `packages/smithers/agent/fs` reached rc.0 still asking for
 * `@smthrs/core@0.1.0` that way.
 *
 * The check is a comparison, not an install: it reads the lockfile's own
 * `workspaces` table, which records the dependency ranges Bun resolved for
 * each workspace, and holds it against the manifests on disk. That runs
 * offline in milliseconds and needs no Bun on the machine.
