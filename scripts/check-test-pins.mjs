/**
 * Fails when a test pin in any package group is not written down in
 * scripts/test-pins.md.
 *
 * A pin is a test the default gate never runs to a pass. Three forms count:
 * `it.fails`/`test.fails` (an assertion that current behavior is wrong),
 * `.skip`/`.todo` (disabled outright), and a `.skipIf`/`.runIf` gated on an
 * environment variable nothing in the repo sets. All three are legitimate
 * occasionally and all three rot silently, so the rule is not "no pins" — it is
 * "no pin the docs do not explain". The 2026-08-16 readiness audit's F4 line
 * item existed because nothing enforced that.
 *
 * A `.skipIf`/`.runIf` on `process.platform`, on an installed binary, or on a
 * built artifact is a capability gate, not a pin: it runs on the supported
 * configuration.
 *
 * Group membership comes from `smthrs.group`, the same authority the release
 * train uses, so a new package is covered without being listed here. The 1.0
 * release train packs the engine and agent groups together, so the register
 * covers every group: an unexplained pin in a package a user installs is the
 * case this guard exists for.
