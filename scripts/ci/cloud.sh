# Smithers Cloud CI runner.
#
# Cloud gives this repo a pool of at most 5 small gVisor runners, and each task
# runs in its own fresh sandbox. Every task therefore pays the JS bootstrap
# (npm + pnpm + `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`) from
# scratch, which alone costs about 11 minutes before a single gate runs. With
# one task per gate that was 39 tasks x ~12 minutes over 5 runners, so 1.5-2
# hours per push: run 11697 (2026-09-15) still had 4 tasks running and 35
# queued after 20 minutes.
#
# So .smithers/workflows/ci.tsx batches the gates (46 as of 2026-09-23) into 6 tasks, and each
# task calls the group mode here:
#
#   bash scripts/ci/cloud.sh <gate>                  # one gate (unchanged)
#   bash scripts/ci/cloud.sh group <gate> <gate>...  # bootstrap once, run many
#
# Group mode installs the union of its gates' toolchains exactly once, then
# runs each gate in order and prints `::gate <name> start`, then `::gate <name>
# ok` or `::gate <name> fail`. A failing gate does not stop the ones after it;
# the task exits non-zero at the end instead, so a single task still reports
# every gate's result. Groups are chosen to share toolchains (jj, Foundry,
# Rust) and to even out wall-clock time; ci.tsx holds the partition.
#
# Each Cloud task gets its own checkout. Keep tool installs and caches local.

# Node's own `http` and `https` clients ignore `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`;
# curl, npm and pnpm read them themselves, which is why every download this
# script performs already works. A Cloud runner pod has no direct egress at
# all — a NetworkPolicy drops every connect that is not kube-dns, the API or
# the Squid egress proxy — so a Node program that connects directly is not
# refused, it is blackholed, and the only symptom is that program's own
# timeout.
#
# That is `//apps/app:devkit` on runs 11723, 11727, 11734 and 11736: electrobun
# fetches its Hutch artifact index with `https.get`, the SYN went nowhere, and
# the gate reported "Hutch artifact index timed out". Every host that path
# needs is on the runner allowlist already (`github.com`,
# `githubusercontent.com`), and the Hutch binary it installs reads the proxy
# variables on its own; only Node had to be told.
#
# `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` makes Node's built-in clients read the same variables
# (the Node `ensure_node` pins from .node-version). Set only when a proxy is
# configured, so a developer reproducing a gate keeps direct connections.
