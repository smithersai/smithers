/**
 * No fault case may focus, skip, or park itself unnoticed, and none may exist
 * under no gate.
 *
 * Ported from the Smithers 0.x `fault-skip-audit-gate` and `fault-only-todo-audit`
 * suites. Those drove a standalone `check-fault-skips.mjs` against synthetic
 * fixtures; the script is gone, so what survives is the audit itself, run
 * against the real matrix.
 *
 * Process-level scenarios live under the CLI's `test/faults/` tree; component
 * fault cases live with their owning package. Every package carrying cases
 * declares a `faults` target, so `//packages/...:faults` is
 * the whole matrix. That move deleted the manifest the old audit read
 * (`e2e/fault-matrix.json`) along with the runner that read it, so the two jobs
 * the manifest actually did — a case may not exist undeclared, and a case may
 * not skip undeclared — are done here instead, against the filesystem and the
 * package declarations that replaced it.
 *
 * The failure modes are different. A focused test (`.only`) silently drops
 * every other case in its file, and a `.todo` reports as a pass. Both are
 * refused outright, and so is an inverted expectation (`.fails`).
 *
 * `.fails` is refused for a narrow reason, and the reason is not "a matrix may
 * not contain a failing test". The opposite: when the product does not meet a
 * requirement the matrix is required to cover, the sanctioned form is a plain
 * test that fails, kept in the matrix with its owner cited in the case file,
 * and reported as a failure in the gate line. `requiredRedGates` below lists
 * the ones that exist, and this suite asserts they are still there. What
 * `.fails` does is turn exactly that test into a pass: the run goes green, the
 * gate line stops naming the defect, and the requirement is enforced by
 * nothing. So the rule is about the marking, not about the colour — state the
 * requirement as a plain failing test and record the shipped limitation in
 * `fault-gaps.md` beside this file.
 *
 * A required red gate is also a shipped limitation, and a shipped limitation
 * that is only written down in `fault-gaps.md` is written down where no reader
 * of the release looks. Each entry in `requiredRedGates` therefore names the
 * release-notes section that states the limitation, and this suite checks that
 * the fault-gaps row points at it.
 *
 * A conditional skip is legitimate — cases 12 and 21 need the `jj` binary —
 * but every one has to be listed here with the condition it skips on, so "this
 * case has not run in six months" is a fact somebody chose rather than one
 * nobody noticed.
 *
 * Run it with `node --test "scripts/repo-contract/*.test.mjs"`.
