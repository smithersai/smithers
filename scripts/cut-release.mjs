/**
 * Cuts one release in the working copy: the version bump, the changelog
 * section, and the two verifications that prove both landed.
 *
 * Before this script the bump and the changelog were separate operator moves
 * with nothing sequencing them, and only one of them was checked. The version
 * setter has had a `--check` mode since it was written, `release.yml` runs it,
 * and a tag whose manifests disagreed with it failed loudly. The changelog had
 * no such gate at all, so the release that shipped with a missing section
 * shipped green.
 *
 * The script writes and then re-reads. Writing and verifying are separate
 * passes on purpose: the check is the same one `release.yml` runs, so a cut
 * that passes here is a cut whose release job reaches the pack step.
 *
 * Nothing here pushes. `--commit` records the cut and tags it locally; the tag
 * push is the irreversible half and stays an operator's own keystroke, because
 * pushing a `v*` tag is what starts the publish.
 *
 * usage:
 *   node scripts/cut-release.mjs <version> [--commit] [--allow-branch]
 *
 *   <version>   the release version, without the leading `v`
 *   --commit    also commit the cut and create an annotated `v<version>` tag
 *   --allow-branch  permit `--commit` on a named branch other than `main`
