/**
 * Sets one version across every workspace manifest, including the exact
 * `@smthrs/*` ranges the workspaces use for each other.
 *
 * The release workflow refuses a tag whose version does not match every engine
 * manifest, and the published packages depend on their siblings by exact
 * version. So a release bump is not `version` alone: an engine package
 * published as 0.1.0-next.0 that still depends on `@smthrs/kernel@0.1.0`
 * installs to a version nobody published. This rewrites both halves in one
 * pass, across every group, so the workspace stays resolvable afterwards.
 *
 * A few published sources also carry the release version as a literal, because
 * a package cannot read its own manifest on every runtime it supports. Those
 * declarations are listed in `versionedSources` and rewritten in the same pass.
 *
 * usage:
 *   node scripts/set-release-version.mjs <version>     rewrite manifests
 *   node scripts/set-release-version.mjs --check <version>
 *                                                      report drift, exit 1
