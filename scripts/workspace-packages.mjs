 * The one reading of workspace membership every gate and release script shares.
 *
 * A package's directory is not its identity. `@smthrs/canonical` publishes that
 * name from `packages/smithers/flows/canonical`, nested inside the product package it
 * belongs to so the relationship is visible in the tree, and publishes exactly
 * what it published from a top-level directory. Every script that used to answer
 * "what are the workspace's packages?" with `readdirSync("packages")` answered
 * it one directory deep, and each one would have to learn about nesting
 * separately. They read this module instead, so nesting is decided once.
 *
 * Membership comes from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which is what pnpm itself
 * installs from, rather than from the filesystem shape. A directory that is not
 * a declared member is not a package here even if it holds a `package.json`
 * (a scaffolding template, a generated `dist/cjs/package.json`), and a declared
 * member is a package wherever it lives.
