 *
 * Re-pinned 2026-09-01: the two cases below used to read the live register and
 * the live `packages/smithers/flows/database` pin. `ef7ee4d0c0` unpinned that test once the
 * open path's read-only probe brought it inside the package's per-test budget,
 * so the register row they quoted stopped naming a pin and both cases went
 * vacuous: the wrong-package variant found nothing to report and asserted
 * nothing. The rule under test is unchanged. Only the pin it reads moved, from
 * whatever the tree happens to pin today to a fixture this file owns, which is
 * why `findPins` and `undocumentedPins` are exported at all.
