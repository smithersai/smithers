/**
 * Containment is a property of the `ChildProcessSpawner` SERVICE, not of any
 * call site.
 *
 * A host decides its kill policy once, by decorating that service.
 * `ContainedSpawner` records a prepared supervisor in the `ProcessLedger`
 * before activating its target; every module that resolves the tag inherits
 * that ownership and cleanup policy. A module that reaches for `child_process` (or
 * `cluster`) instead inherits neither: its children outlive a cancel by
 * however long they choose, and a hard-killed host leaves them with nothing
 * recording that they exist, so the next incarnation cannot reap them.
 *
 * No behavioral test can see that. The bypassing module works, its own suite
 * is green, and the only symptom is a process still running on someone's
 * machine after the flow that started it was cancelled. So the bypass is
 * checked for directly, over the whole repository rather than one package:
 * `packages/smithers/agent/std/test/ExecContainment.test.ts` carries the same assertion
 * scoped to `std` alone, where it fails fast during work on that package, and
 * this suite is the universe.
 *
 * Both read `packages/smithers/flows/test/SpawnSpecifiers.ts`, which parses each file
 * and asks the syntax tree. One reader means this gate can never be narrower
 * than the package-local one, and a parser means neither can be defeated by
 * an import's LAYOUT. The three regex readers that came before were each one
 * layout wide, and the last one missed the multi-line import `dprint` itself
 * produces for any import over 120 characters. The reader's fixtures, one
 * file per layout, live beside it in
 * `packages/smithers/flows/test/SpawnSpecifiers.test.ts`.
 *
 * The exceptions are named here with their ownership boundary and limitations, not
 * derived from what happens to be in the tree. The list is checked in both
 * directions, the way the coverage-gate deferral next door is: an unlisted
 * importer fails, and a listed file that no longer imports a process-starting
 * module fails too, so the list expires on its own instead of quietly widening
 * the exemption. The matcher itself is pinned against fixtures, because every
 * spelling it fails to recognize is a bypass that reads as compliance.
