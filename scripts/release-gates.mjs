 * (`flows/release-support/operations.ts`) runs each entry, in order, as its
 * `checks` step. The hand-written `.github/workflows/release.yml` cannot import
 * it, so `release-gates.test.mjs` proves parity in both directions: every
 * entry here is a publish-job step with the same name and command, and every
 * `pnpm exec smthrs` step in the publish job is either an entry here or a
 * declared {@link releaseGateExceptions} entry. Before the second direction
 * existed the inventory held 12 gates, only 10 mirrored, for 35 workflow
 * gates, and the flow-driven release required substantially less evidence.
 *
 * Ordinary `ci '//packages/...'` deliberately excludes the `faults` tier, so
 * that selection is spelled out here with the same serial `--jobs 1` the
 * workflow uses: the fault suites hold exclusive resources and cannot share a
