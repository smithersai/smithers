/**
 * Renders one release's commit-level `CHANGELOG.md` section from git history.
 *
 * The file is the complete, commit-level changelog, and until this script
 * existed every section of it was typed by hand. A hand-typed section is
 * missing the moment a release is cut in a hurry, and nothing in the release
 * pipeline noticed: `.github/workflows/release.yml` checked the tag, the
 * manifests, and the packed set, then published a version whose changelog said
 * nothing about it.
 *
 * ## What is generated, and what is not
 *
 * A release section has two halves. The narrative — what changed and why it
 * matters — is written by a person, and this script never touches it. The
 * commit list under it is mechanical, and this script owns exactly that,
 * delimited by a marker pair:
 *
 * ```md
 * ## 1.0.0-rc.0 (2026-08-31)
 *
 * The first release candidate of Smithers 1.0. …hand-written narrative…
 *
 * <!-- commits:1.0.0-rc.0 -->
 *
 * 1230 commits since [v0.35.0](…).
 *
 * ### 🐛 Bug fixes
 *
 * - **engine:** … ([369a03babf](…))
 *
 * <!-- /commits:1.0.0-rc.0 -->
 * ```
 *
 * Writing replaces only what sits between the markers, so regenerating a
 * section can never eat the prose above it. When the version has no section at
 * all, one is opened with a `## <version> (<date>)` heading above the newest
 * existing release, and the block goes inside it.
 *
 * ## Determinism
 *
 * Two runs over the same range produce identical bytes. The date in a new
 * heading is the `--to` commit's own committer date, never the clock, and an
 * existing heading is left exactly as it stands. Commits of type `release` are
 * skipped, so the release commit a cut adds between generating the section and
 * tagging it does not make that section stale.
 *
 * ## Why every mode has a no-repository half
 *
 * `//:changelog` drift-checks by running this script inside a scratch copy of
 * the tree and diffing `changes` against the real one, and that copy
 * deliberately carries no `.git` (`versionControl` in
 * `PackageTree.scratchCopy`,
 * `packages/smithers/build/build-cli/src/PackageTree.ts:1266`). A generator
 * that needed history there would fail every lint, and one that did nothing
 * there would pass every lint without checking anything. So both modes fall
 * back to the block itself:
 *
 * - With a repository, the range is re-read from git. Writing rewrites the
 *   block; `--check` compares byte for byte and is the gate `release.yml` runs
 *   at the tag, where a missing or stale section fails the release.
 * - Without one, the block is parsed back into commits and re-rendered from
 *   its own contents. That proves the grouping, the order, the labels, the
 *   links, and the count are the ones this script produces, which is the drift
 *   a hand edit introduces. It cannot prove the block still matches history,
 *   and `--check` says so rather than reporting a pass it did not earn. A
 *   version with no block at all fails either way.
 *
 * usage:
 *   node scripts/generate-changelog.mjs [options]
 *
 *   --version <v>  the release to render (default: packages/smithers version)
 *   --from <ref>   range start, exclusive (default: the nearest v* tag below --to, never v<version> itself)
 *   --to <ref>     range end, inclusive (default: HEAD)
 *   --check        report drift and exit 1 instead of writing
