# Artsy AI-check references and compatibility

Read-only investigation completed 2026-09-16 by the delegated Artsy review agent. Neither application source nor Artsy source was changed. No model sessions or full Artsy package graphs were executed.

Source links into Smithers are repository-relative. Artsy links refer to the sibling `../artsy` checkout inspected for this audit; the source examples themselves are not vendored into these docs. The findings and executed-check record below are preserved here so the audit does not depend on an ignored scratch directory.

## Reusable examples

- [Honcho telemetry registry rule](../../../../artsy/honcho/workflows/lints/telemetry-registry.md:1): missing event registrations, unbounded labels, replica-unsafe gauges, incorrect gauge aggregation, and telemetry failures escaping into product work. [Declaration](../../../../artsy/honcho/PACKAGE.ts:117), [quality/prePush/CI composition](../../../../artsy/honcho/PACKAGE.ts:242), [approved issue flow](../../../../artsy/honcho/workflows/approved-issue/PACKAGE.ts:20).
- [Shade Tree log hygiene rule](../../../../artsy/shade-tree-node/workflows/lints/log-hygiene.md:7): semantic privacy violations beyond deterministic secret scanning. Its fixes must preserve the useful diagnostic signal. [Declaration](../../../../artsy/shade-tree-node/PACKAGE.ts:268), [prePush](../../../../artsy/shade-tree-node/PACKAGE.ts:383), [implementation loop](../../../../artsy/shade-tree-node/workflows/ship-roadmap/PACKAGE.ts:129).
- [Cheap checks first](../../../../artsy/shade-tree-node/workflows/lints/cheap-checks-first.md:21): identify expensive verification that precedes a valid cheap rejection, with offending input and legitimate exceptions.

The reusable format is a narrow rule, concrete violations and exceptions, scoped input/context, structured findings, and configured consequences. A generic score is insufficient.

## Executed checks

| Check | Observed result | Scope of evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Three actual Artsy S.Agent.Lint declarations instantiated and decoded with current @smthrs/targets | Passed on Node 24.18; each plans one smithers-build/agent-lint check action | API and planning compatibility |
| build-cli AgentSession.test.ts filtered to Agent.Lint | 10 passed; 91 unrelated tests skipped | Empty-diff behavior, blocking/advisory findings, cache invalidation, bounded fix enforcement; scripted model responses |
| targets AgentTarget.test.ts | 14 passed | Declarations, schemas, action payloads |
| Shade Tree node lib/log.selftest.mjs | 30 assertions passed | Logger formatting, routing, context, redaction, serialization |
| Honcho node workflows/gates/sdk-version-parity.mjs | Passed; version 2.4.0 | Deterministic gate execution |

The [Honcho telemetry tests](../../../../artsy/honcho/tests/telemetry/test_metric_zero_init.py:74) were inspected, not executed; the checkout has no Python virtual environment. No live model-backed rubric eval was run. These results do not establish the prompts' real-world precision or recall.

Installed Bun 1.4.0 canary could not directly import current targets because it lacks node:util.getCallSites. The supported Node probe passed. This is a runtime compatibility limit for the inspected environment, not an obsolete S.Agent.Lint API: the current wrapper is [Action.make-backed](../../../packages/smithers/build/targets/src/AgentTarget.ts:656).

## Required adaptations

1. **Actual PR diff.** The declarations omit a base, and [gitDiff defaults to HEAD](../../../packages/smithers/build/targets/src/Input.ts:195). [Execution compares the working tree against that base](../../../packages/smithers/build/build-cli/src/AgentSession.ts:748). A clean committed PR can therefore receive no review. Bind the appropriate PR comparison/candidate and test that case.
2. **Call-site coverage.** Honcho scopes its rule to src/telemetry/** and tests/telemetry/**. An observability requirement for new handlers must also inspect those handlers and jobs.
3. **Explicit context.** The [review session has no tools](../../../packages/smithers/build/build-cli/src/AgentSession.ts:1431). Supply relevant source, registries, helpers, conventions, and evidence; don't assume the model can explore the repository.
4. **Independent final verdict.** Current [check mode](../../../packages/smithers/build/build-cli/src/AgentSession.ts:1579) blocks warning/error findings and preserves informational findings. A product-level report/required policy must be explicit. After repair, rerun the check against the resulting code instead of accepting the repair model's own remaining-findings claim.
5. **Rubric evals.** Cover violations, compliant code, legitimate exceptions, unrelated changes, omitted instrumentation outside the telemetry module, clean committed PRs, malformed output, insufficient context, and model failure.

## Migrate instead of copying

- [agent-session-search observability prompt](../../../../artsy/agent-session-search/.smithers/prompts/sweep-observability.mdx:1) has useful concerns but edits code and awards itself a score. Its [audit wrapper](../../../../artsy/agent-session-search/.smithers/workflows/audit.tsx:6) uses obsolete createSmithers/JSX authoring.
- [smithers-samples dependencies](../../../../artsy/smithers-samples/package.json:10) contain absolute paths to removed package locations. Fresh-looking syntax is not proof of a runnable package.
