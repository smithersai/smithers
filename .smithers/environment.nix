# The Smithers Cloud machine for this repository.
#
# Owner decision (2026-09-15): Cloud machines are NixOS built from a
# per-repository `.smithers/environment.nix`, and Cloud CI moves off the Debian
# runner pool onto NixOS guests booted from this closure. This module is
# imported after `nix/modules/base.nix` in the plue repository (see that repo's
# `nix/README.md`); it adds to the base and never replaces it. Only the file
# itself reaches the builder, so it carries no relative imports.
#
# Everything `scripts/ci/cloud.sh` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` install at run
# time is pinned here instead, at the exact release the repository declares, so
# a gate starts with its toolchain already on PATH and downloads nothing:
#
#   Node       .node-version / package.json engines.node
#   npm        PACKAGE.ts `CiToolchain.Node({ npmRelease })`
#   pnpm       package.json packageManager
#   Bun        .smithers/WORKSPACE.ts bunVersion
#   jj         .smithers/WORKSPACE.ts jjVersion
#   Rust       rust-toolchain.toml (channel, components, targets)
#   Go         PACKAGE.ts `CiToolchain.Go`
#   Foundry    PACKAGE.ts `CiToolchain.Foundry` / cloud.sh ensure_foundry
#   ripgrep    PACKAGE.ts `CiToolchain.Ripgrep` (the base pin already matches)
#
# `scripts/ci/environment-nix.test.ts` reads those files and this one and fails
# on drift, so a version moves in one place.
#
# The base module already ships bash, coreutils, curl, git, jq, python3,
# ripgrep 14.1.1, rsync, procps and the language servers. Node, npm, Bun and jj
# are in the base too, at the versions the platform picked rather than the ones
# this repository pins, so each of those four is `lib.hiPrio` here: NixOS builds
# the system profile with `buildEnv { ignoreCollisions = true; }`, which settles
# a colliding `bin/` entry by `meta.priority` before order, and the base module
# is imported first.
