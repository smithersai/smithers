"""What a finished Harbor trial means for scoring.

A trial is healthy only when it was graded, or graded after a whitelisted
agent outcome: the agent ran out of time (AgentTimeoutError), or the agent's
own process exited nonzero (NonZeroAgentExitCodeError) with no SSH or
workspace-gateway transport error in its output. Every other exception, and a
whitelisted one with no grade, is infrastructure: re-run, never scored. That
list is open on purpose: a new exception type is infra until someone argues
it into the whitelist.

    classify(result.json dict) -> "graded" | "agent" | "infra" | "unplaceable" | "running"

`unplaceable` (PlueUnplaceable) is a known capacity limit of the cluster: not
scored, not retried, and not counted in the infra rate.
