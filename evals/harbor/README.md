# Harbor and Pier benchmark adapter

The Smithers flows harness as an external agent for [Harbor](https://www.harborframework.com)
(Terminal-Bench 4.0) and [Pier](https://github.com/datacurve-ai/pier) (DeepSWE
1.1). Harbor starts the task's container; `smithers_agent.py` runs OUR harness
on the host, the `smthrs` CLI out of this checkout, with the task instruction
as the flow's whole task and the task container as the only thing its `bash`
flow may touch. Every command reaches the container by `docker exec`, the same
seam the SWE-bench rig uses (`packages/smithers/agent/std/src/Container.ts`).
The model is called from the host, so the container keeps the task's
`no-network` seal.

This is an **operator-run** benchmark. It spends a model seat, needs docker and
the task images, and is not a CI gate. `./verify.sh` is the offline check of the
adapter's own logic and is the only thing here CI runs.

## Layout

| Path                      | What it is                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `smithers_agent.py`       | `SmithersAgent`, the Harbor/Pier `BaseAgent` that drives the harness   |
| `plue_env.py`             | `PlueEnvironment` / `PluePierEnvironment`: the task on a Smithers Cloud workspace, public CLI only |
| `outcome.py`              | Which finished trials are scored (graded, agent outcome) and which are infra, re-run |
| `health.py`, `requeue.py` | Mid-run health rule; move infra trials aside for `harbor jobs resume` |
| `plue_docker.py`          | The `docker` the harness calls on Smithers Cloud: `exec` becomes `smithers workspace exec` |
| `accounts.py`             | Round-robin over every logged-in Codex subscription, one per trial     |
| `codex_pool.py`           | Harbor's stock Codex CLI agent drawing its `auth.json` from that pool  |
| `prompt.md`               | The one flow file every task runs; the instruction is pasted verbatim  |
| `audit_host_calls.py`     | Per-trial audit of `bash` calls that ran on the host, not the task container: clean / host-calls-benign / TAINTED |
| `verify.sh`               | Offline check: prompt, environment, journal fold, trajectory, names    |
| `fixtures/check_agent.py` | What `verify.sh` runs                                                  |

## Prerequisites

1. Build the CLI: `pnpm --filter @smthrs/cli build`. The adapter refuses to
   run against `src/bin.ts`, for the reason `evals/swebench/flows.sh` gives.
2. Build the atomic filesystem helper the CLI shells out to:
   `cargo +1.98.0 build --release -p smithers-ffi --bin smithers-jj-export`
   (the crate requires rustc 1.98; the repository toolchain file pins 1.89 for
   the wasm artifact). The CLI
   looks for it at `/usr/local/bin/smithers-jj-export` or
   `SMITHERS_WORKSPACE_JJ_EXPORT_BINARY`; the adapter sets the variable to
   `target/release/smithers-jj-export` when it is there and the variable is not.
3. A seat. For the ChatGPT subscription: `codex login` once, then
   `SMITHERS_OPENAI_AUTH=chatgpt` (the default the adapter picks for an
   `openai` seat). `OPENAI_API_KEY` is removed from the CLI's environment in
   that mode, so a fallback to the API cannot succeed silently.
4. `uv tool install harbor` and, for DeepSWE, `uv tool install datacurve-pier`.
   Both import the adapter by module path, so run them with
   `PYTHONPATH=<this checkout>` from the checkout root.

## Running

Terminal-Bench 4.0, two tasks, one attempt each, one at a time:

```sh
cd <checkout>
PYTHONPATH=$PWD harbor run -d terminal-bench/terminal-bench@4.0.0 \
  -i wal-recovery-ordering -i sound-change-cascade \
  -a evals.harbor.smithers_agent:SmithersAgent -m openai/gpt-6-sol \
  -k 1 -n 1 -o "$PWD/evals/harbor/jobs" --job-name smithers-smoke -y
```

The oracle arm proves the sandbox and the verifier (`--agent oracle`); the
stock Codex CLI arm is `-a codex -m openai/gpt-6-sol` with
`--ae CODEX_FORCE_AUTH_JSON=1` to use the ChatGPT login instead of an API key.
Every task runs at `effort: max` (`prompt.md`), the top of the OpenAI scale
and what the Terminal-Bench leaderboard's Codex entries ran at; the journal's
`model-requested` params say which effort each call was really made at and
`smithers-run.json` folds them into `run.efforts`.

### On Smithers Cloud

Add `-e evals.harbor.plue_env:PlueEnvironment` and the task runs in a plue
workspace through the public `smithers` CLI (`SMITHERS_CLI`, `PLUE_REPO`,
`SMITHERS_TOKEN`; see `plue_env.py`). The harness still speaks `docker exec`:
the adapter puts `plue_docker.py` first on the CLI's PATH as `docker`, and the
workspace id is the container the prompt names. The harness spawns that
`docker` with a least-authority environment (PATH, HOME, USER, LANG, TERM,
TMPDIR, SHELL), so the adapter writes the repository, the CLI's absolute path,
`SMITHERS_TOKEN` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` into an owner-only `plue-docker.json`
beside the shim in a per-attempt temporary directory, deleted when the attempt
ends.

Waiting for capacity is not building the environment, so it happens before
Harbor's environment-start timer: importing `PlueEnvironment` makes Harbor
await `environment.reserve()` (slot, capacity wait, workspace boot) ahead of
the timed `start()`. A create that finds no capacity waits
(`PLUE_CAPACITY_WAIT_SEC`) instead of failing the trial. Two arms on one host
share `PLUE_SLOTS` first come, first served (a slot is 2 vCPU), and a task
bigger than `PLUE_MAX_CPUS`, or one needing a GPU, raises `PlueUnplaceable`
from `reserve()`, inside the trial. `PLUE_MAX_WORKSPACES` caps running
workspaces at the account plan's concurrent-sandbox limit. Every TB4 task
verifies in a separate workspace: the agent workspace hands its ledger slot
to its own verifier, whose `reserve()` also runs before Harbor's build timer.
A workspace SSH session the gateway lost (`ssh_session_failed`) or OpenSSH's
own exit 255 (`ssh_transport`: connect timeout, remote closed, dead read)
raises `PlueError` instead of passing the command a meaningless status.

No plue failure ends the job: every environment method raises `PlueError`
or a subclass, Harbor's constructor checks are deferred to `reserve()`
(Harbor builds the environment in `Trial.create`, outside the trial's
exception handling), the Trial's own artifact and network-policy refusals
are deferred to `_prepare()`, and `stop()` never raises; a workspace it could
not delete goes to `PLUE_LEAK_LOG`. A task that needs a GPU, more than
`PLUE_MAX_CPUS`, or compose sidecars is `PlueUnplaceable`: a plue workspace
is one guest with no network to other workspaces, and running a sidecar in
it would hand the agent the sidecar's files.

Both arms draw one Codex login per trial from `accounts.py`: `~/.codex`
(label `default`) and `~/.smithers/accounts/codex-*` in round robin, state in
`SMITHERS_CODEX_POOL_STATE` shared across runner processes. The label is
recorded per trial (`smithers-run.json` `account`, `codex-account.json` for
the stock arm). The stock arm is
`-a evals.harbor.codex_pool:PooledCodex --ak version=0.155.1 --ak reasoning_effort=max`.

**An infrastructure failure is never a score.** Both agents apply one policy:

- A usage limit (`rate_limited: The usage limit has been reached`,
  `quota_exceeded`, the Codex CLI's "You've hit your usage limit") takes the
  account out of rotation with the reset time the message names, and the
  trial is re-run whole on the next healthy account. Every re-run is in the
  trial's `agent/requeue.log` and in `requeues` of `smithers-run.json` /
  `codex-account.json`; the earlier attempt's log and workspace are kept as
  `*-attempt-N`.
- A route fault (`authentication`, `no_route`, `provider_internal`,
  `transport`, `completion_unjudged`, a `rate_limited` the
  harness gave up on) raises `ModelRouteError`, so Harbor records an
  exception and no reward.
- A trial in which no command reached the task container with exit 0
  raises `ContainerUnreachable`: for this adapter, no journalled `bash` call
  naming the container settled with `exitCode` 0; for the stock arm, no
  `command_execution` item in `codex.txt` exited 0. The count is
  `containerCommands` in `smithers-run.json` / `codex-account.json`.
- A trial is healthy only when it was graded, or graded after a whitelisted
  agent outcome: `AgentTimeoutError`, or `NonZeroAgentExitCodeError` with no
  SSH or gateway transport error in its output (`outcome.py`). Everything
  else (`VerifierTimeoutError`, `CancelledError`, `PlueError`, start and
  setup timeouts, `ContainerUnreachable`, `ModelRouteError`, an ungraded
  agent outcome) is infrastructure: re-run, never scored. Run with `-r 3` and
  one `--retry-include` per name in `outcome.INFRA_EXCEPTIONS`; after the
  harbor process exits, `requeue.py <job>` moves the remaining infra and
  unfinished trials to `<job>.infra/` and `harbor jobs resume -p <job>`
  re-runs them. `health.py` trips when infra is over 20% of a job's trials
  finished in the last hour. `PlueUnplaceable` is neither retried nor
  scored: the guest cannot fit this cluster.
- When no healthy account is left the pool PAUSES: a lease waits
  (`SMITHERS_CODEX_POOL_WAIT_SEC`, default six hours) for a reset or a new
  `codex-*` login, then raises `NoSeatLeft`. `pool.json` carries `paused`.
- The model's own failures (`claim_unproven`, `read_only_cap`, a wrong
  answer) are scored as the verifier says. So is `call_timeout`: the
  harness's per-call ceiling (`modelCallMs`, 1,800 s at the prompt's
  `effort: max`) is the arm's own limit.

The full benchmark drops the `-i` filters and raises `-n`. Use an absolute
`-o`: Harbor resolves a relative jobs directory against the task's `tests/`
directory when it copies artifacts into the verifier container, and the copy
falls back to a slower tar stream.

DeepSWE 1.1 through Pier, one task:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=$PWD pier run -p <deep-swe>/tasks/<task> \
  --agent-import-path evals.harbor.smithers_agent:SmithersAgent \
  -m openai/gpt-6-sol -k 1 -n 1 -o "$PWD/evals/harbor/jobs"
```

DeepSWE grades `git diff <base>..HEAD`, so under Pier the prompt tells the
model to commit and the adapter commits whatever is left afterwards
(`--ak commit=1` does the same under Harbor).

## What a trial records

Under the trial's `agent/` directory:

| File                | Contents                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `smithers-run.json` | seat, auth mode, route bindings off the journal, harness revision, subject fingerprint, wall clock, tokens, exit status, phase |
| `trajectory.json`   | ATIF-v1.8 trajectory folded from the harness journal; Harbor reads the token totals off it   |
| `smithers-run.log`  | the CLI's stdout and stderr                                                                  |
| `workspace/`        | the flow file and `.flows/engine.db`, the journal itself                                     |

Runs on the ChatGPT subscription are subscription-billed: `cost_usd` is left
unset rather than priced. `evals/swebench/prices.ts` carries the API list
price for `gpt-6-sol` ($2 in, $0.20 cached, $10 out per 1M tokens, standard
tier, short context) for the api-key arm; quote it against a subscription run
only as what the tokens would have cost.

## What the smoke showed, and what is not yet right

The 2026-09-22 smoke (oracle, this adapter, and the stock Codex CLI on
`wal-recovery-ordering` and `sound-change-cascade`; this adapter on DeepSWE
`abs-module-cache-flags` through Pier) found two things a reader of
`smithers-run.json` needs to know:

- **The claim brake refused true container claims.** The harness does see
  container edits: a `bash` call into the container reports `mutated`, which
  counts as a remote mutation, and Jev was sent `treeMoved: true`. What it
  lacked was the checks' output, and it read long, specific claims as a whole.
  The 2026-09-26 Luna smoke ended two of four runs `claim_unproven` at 0.91
  and 0.87 with the work on the record. The brake now lists each check with the
  tail of its output and reads a long claim one sentence at a time; replayed,
  those claims read at most 0.71 and 0.73 and a fabricated sentence 0.94 and
  0.92. Grade on the verifier's reward all the same, and read `run.status` as
  the harness's opinion of its own evidence.
- **Jev is mandatory.** The CLI refuses to run without `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`,
  and a gateway 503 on the final completion fails the run as
  `completion_unjudged` after the work is done. Export the key before a run;
  a subscription seat does not cover it.

## What the agent never sees

The prompt is `prompt.md` with the instruction, the container id, the working
directory and the seat filled in. The adapter discards the `task_dir` and
`trial_paths` Harbor hands every agent, never reads `tests/` or `solution/`,
and uploads nothing into the container. `fixtures/check_agent.py` pins that
the rendered prompt names none of them.
