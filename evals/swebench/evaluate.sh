# Grades collected model patches with the official SWE-bench harness.
#
#   evaluate.sh <run-id> <instance_id> [<instance_id> ...]
#
# Reads patches/ by default; set HARNESS=codex to grade patches-codex/ instead.
# Both defaults sit under SWB_ARTIFACT_ROOT when it is set, derived by
# `lib/run-paths.sh --roots` — the same derivation the run scripts write
# through — so a wave run off the checkout is graded where it was written
# rather than as a set of missing (and so refused) predictions.
# Writes preds-<run-id>.json and the evaluator's own report,
# <model-name>.<run-id>.json, into this directory. Both are transient and
# gitignored; the scorecard reads the report.
#
# Two overrides serve the best-of-n matrix, where one instance has n patches and
# the evaluator's predictions can only be keyed by instance id:
#
#   SWB_PATCH_SUFFIX=-r3   grade <id>-r3.patch as <id>'s prediction
#   SWB_PATCHES=selected   grade a different directory: absolute, or relative
#                          to this one
#   SWB_MODEL_NAME=...     the model name the report is filed under
#
# So a 25-run flows matrix grades as five run ids, one per round, and the
# selected patches grade as a sixth. `grade-matrix.sh` drives all of it.
#
# SWB_EVAL_WORKERS sets the evaluator's concurrency. It defaults to 1, and
# raising it is not merely a speed/disk tradeoff: with this evaluator (swebench
# 4.0.4) and `--cache_level env`, concurrent workers race in the post-run image
# cleanup and the run dies with `docker.errors.ImageNotFound` on an image
# another worker already removed. Every instance still grades — the 2026-08-19
# attempt logged "2 ran successfully, 0 failed" — but the crash happens before
# the report is written, so the whole grading is lost. Measured on the same two
# instances: workers=3 crashed with no report, workers=1 wrote the report.
#
# The wave itself (run-sample.sh) is a different matter and does run its
# instances concurrently; only grading serializes.
#
# That serialization is rig-wide, not per-caller: the full benchmark grades an
# instance the moment its patch exists, so it and a `grade-matrix.sh` started by
# hand are two evaluator processes racing the same image cleanup on the same
# docker daemon. Every invocation therefore takes `.grade-lock` through
# `lib/lock.sh`, which releases it by owner and takes it back from a pid that is
# gone. A caller that already holds it says so with SWB_GRADE_LOCK_HELD=1 —
# `lib/fullbench-instance.sh` does, because it holds the lock across the verdict
# it reads afterwards — and this then grades without taking it a second time.
#
# ## The psf/requests family and httpbin
#
# `psf/requests`' graded tests are network tests: `test_requests.py` reads
# `HTTPBIN = os.environ.get('HTTPBIN_URL', 'http://httpbin.org/')`, and roughly a
# third of the dataset's graded identifiers for `psf__requests-1766` and
# `psf__requests-2317` route through it. The public httpbin.org answered 503
# during the r90 grading, so those tests failed for reasons no patch could
# change — 34 of 2317's `PASS_TO_PASS` tests among them, and a `PASS_TO_PASS`
# test failing indicts the environment by construction.
#
# So when a grading includes any `psf/requests` instance, `lib/httpbin.sh
# resolve` decides which httpbin it will meet and says so out loud: the public
# service when it answers over both http and https, the rig's own container when
# it does not, and a refusal when neither is available. The chosen URL reaches
# `lib/grade.py`, which exports `HTTPBIN_URL` inside that instance's `eval.sh` —
# the variable the suite already reads. It applies to `psf/requests` only, and to
# whichever harness produced the patch, so both arms are graded under one rig.
# Nothing else about the grading changes, and the export is visible in the
# archived `eval.sh` and in `test_output.txt`.
#
#   SWB_HTTPBIN_URL=…  grade against this endpoint, whatever the probe says
#   SWB_NO_HTTPBIN=1   skip the check entirely and let the suite use its own
#                      default, as r90 did — including when it is down
#
# SWB_CACHE_LEVEL is the evaluator's `--cache_level`. It defaults to `env`,
# which deletes each official instance image once that instance is graded — a
# 3 GB re-pull for the next wave. Set it to `instance` for a supplementary
# grading that should leave the image cache as it found it. It changes what is
# kept on disk, never how a patch is graded.
