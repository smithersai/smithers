#   run-sample.sh [flows|codex] [count] [timeout-seconds] [jobs]
#
# Instances run concurrently, `jobs` at a time (default 3). What bounds that
# number is disk, not CPU: every instance keeps a multi-GB extracted testbed for
# the whole wave, and the machine this rig was written on had 27 GB free. The
# extraction itself stays serialized by run-instance.sh's own lock — that is the
# disk-bandwidth spike, and five copies at once can fill the drive before any
# instance's cleanup runs. Overlapping the *agent* runs is what this buys: they
# are network- and model-bound, and wave 2 spent 43 minutes of instance time
# waiting for one instance at a time.
#
# Pass jobs=1 to restore the old strictly-sequential behaviour, which is worth
# doing when a wave is being timed for per-instance wall clock: concurrent runs
# share the host's CPU and docker's 16 GB VM, so an instance's own seconds are
# comparable across a wave but not directly against a sequential baseline.
