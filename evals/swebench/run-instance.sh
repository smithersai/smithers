# With a run index — `run-instance.sh <id> <seat> <budget> r3` — every one of
# those names carries `-r3`, journals/<instance_id>-r3/ included, so five runs
# of one instance coexist and each archive belongs to the patch beside it.
# `lib/run-paths.sh` owns the rule and both harnesses derive their names from
# it. A run
# given an index is a matrix run and deletes its extracted testbed once the patch
# is captured; a run without one keeps the workspace, which is what
# `regen-patch.sh` and the scorecard's default `--work work` read. See README,
# "Best-of-n".

# This spends real API tokens and needs docker. See README.md.
#
# `./preflight.sh` must have pinned the subject first: every flows.sh call in
# here re-checks the pin, and the stamp is copied into the timings record so a

# moves git's HEAD onto each settlement commit and exports one `refs/jj/keep/*`
# ref per visible change. `git log`, `git log --all -S` and `git fsck` then hand
# the agent its own attempt commits as if they were upstream history — measured
# on `django__django-13346` (~$0.54, two of them applied as a fake fix),
# `pydata__xarray-7229` (~$0.20, chased across three frames) and
# `django__django-13821` (~$0.06, `git show`-ed as evidence).
#
# Pointing jj at a bare git repository OUTSIDE the working copy fixes it at the
# source. jj keeps the same working copy, snapshots and restores exactly as
# before, and writes every commit, ref and object into `$VCS` instead. The task
# checkout's refs and object store are untouched, so `git log --all` and
# `git fsck` show only real history — and `git diff` starts working the way an
# agent expects, because jj no longer writes the task repository's index either.
# jj ignores `.git` in a non-colocated working copy, so the checkout's own
# history is never snapshotted.
#
# The scaffolding is excluded through the store's own `core.excludesFile`, which
# jj reads from its backing git repository. A colocated jj read the same list
# out of `$WORK/.git/info/exclude`; a non-colocated one has no reason to look
# there, and without this it would re-hash the growing journal database on every
