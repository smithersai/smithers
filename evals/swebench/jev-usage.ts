 * `supervisor-settled` for the per-frame supervisor, a `cell-call-settled` of
 * the `jev` flow for an agent's own call, whose usage sits inside the recorded
 * call result, and a `decision-settled` of a gate classifier, which carries
 * its own usage. The brake's and the supervisor's `decision-settled` repeat a
 * reading already metered above and are never priced. `scorecard.ts` and
 * `lib/run-cost.mjs` both read through here, so the scorecard and the full
 * benchmark's ledger cannot disagree about what a reading cost.
