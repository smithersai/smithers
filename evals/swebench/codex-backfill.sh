#   ./codex-backfill.sh --status        counts, and stop
#   ./codex-backfill.sh --table         every instance, our verdict and codex's
#
# Every mode takes `--lane`, and it has to: `--status` on the wrong lane reads
# the wrong ledger.
#
# The full benchmark measures the flows harness on all 500 instances. It says
# nothing on its own: a resolved rate is a number about a benchmark until there
# is a second harness on the same instances under the same conditions. This runs
# that second harness over exactly the instances our side has already graded, so
# the two populations are the same set rather than two overlapping samples.
#
# Per instance, in one process, the same shape `lib/fullbench-instance.sh` uses
# and for the same reason — nothing multi-gigabyte may outlive the instance that
# needed it:
#
#   claim -> slot -> disk gate -> pull -> codex run -> archive -> grade -> delete
#
# **Grading happens here, while the image is still local.** Collecting 43 patches
# and grading them afterwards needs every image a second time.
#
# ## Concurrency
#
# `--one` is the unit. A pipeline runs many of them at once, and they share one
# docker daemon, one disk and one evaluator, so the docker-heavy span of an
# instance — its pull, its run, its grading and its delete — is held inside a
# **two-slot semaphore** at `fullbench/.codex-slots`. Two is what the full
# benchmark already proved this machine sustains: two extractions and two
# testbeds fit in the disk gate's 8 GiB headroom and a third does not.
#
# The semaphore is two `lib/lock.sh` locks rather than `flock`, for two reasons.
# `flock(1)` is a util-linux program and is not on macOS, which is the host this
# rig runs on. And a slot has to survive its holder being killed with `-9`: a
# `lib/lock.sh` slot records the holder's pid, so the next waiter takes a dead
# holder's slot on its next poll, while a lock released only by descriptor
# closure tells a waiter nothing about who is gone. That is the same protocol
# the extraction lock and the evaluator lock already use here.
#
# One instance is also claimed by pid, exactly as `lib/fullbench-instance.sh`
# claims its own: two invocations naming one id would be two paid agents writing
# one patch path.
#
# ## Resume
#
# `fullbench/codex-manifest.jsonl` is the ledger, append-only and fsynced.
# **An id with a verdict there is a no-op** — the script exits 0 without
# touching docker. A `started` row (a kill mid-instance) and a `failed` row both
# carry no verdict, so both are retried from the top on the next pass, and the
# retry purges the dead attempt's artifacts and its evaluator report first.
#
# This spends real API tokens and needs docker. See README.md, "The codex
# backfill".

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lanes
#
# A lane is one measurement of the population under one condition. It moves four
# things at once — the archive, the ledger, the run index and the evaluator run
# id — plus the conditions the runs are given, because a lane that moved only
# some of them would grade one condition's patches into another condition's run
# id and no artifact would say so. `run-45.sh` names its lanes the same way and
# for the same reason.
#
# | lane | archive | ledger | index | evaluator run id | network | effort | testbed |
# | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
# | `net` (default) | `fullbench/codex/` | `codex-manifest.jsonl` | `r90c` | `fullbench-codex` | `on` | `medium` | `bridge` |
# | `sealed` | `fullbench/codex-sealed/` | `codex-sealed-manifest.jsonl` | `r90s` | `fullbench-codex-sealed` | `sealed` | `medium` | `bridge` |
# | `sealed-high` | `fullbench/codex-sealed-high/` | `codex-sealed-high-manifest.jsonl` | `r90sh` | `fullbench-codex-sealed-high` | `sealed` | `high` | `bridge` |
# | `none` | `fullbench/codex-none/` | `codex-none-manifest.jsonl` | `r90n` | `fullbench-codex-none` | `sealed` | `high` | `none` |
#
# The lanes are a table rather than a name template: every one of them is a
# claim about how a number may be quoted, and inventing `--lane whatever` on the
# command line would produce an archive nothing in the rig knows how to read.
# `run-instance-codex.sh` documents what each network condition denies.
#
# **Effort is pinned per lane, not taken from the default.** The two `medium`
# lanes above ran before 2026-08-23, when `run-instance-codex.sh` had that value
# written into it as a literal; the default is `high` now, so a lane that did not
# pin its own value would silently re-run at a condition its recorded rows were
# never measured under. `sealed-high` is the same population and the same seal as
# `sealed` with the effort moved to `high`, which is what the flows arm has
# always run at — the whole point of the lane, and the reason two lanes may share
# a network condition while no two share an artifact.
#
# **The testbed network is pinned the same way, and for the same reason.** The
# three lanes above ran before 2026-08-24, when the testbed container kept the
# network so that test behaviour would not change with the condition — and two
# of the 45 `r90s` runs used exactly that, with a
# `docker exec <container> curl …` that fetched the merged upstream fix. The
# default is `none` now, and a lane that did not pin `bridge` would reproduce
# an old number under a condition its rows were never measured under. The
# `none` lane is `sealed-high` with the hole shut: same population, same seal on
# codex's own tools, same effort, and a container with no route out of the
# machine. `sealed-high` and `none` therefore share network *and* effort and
# differ in the testbed, which is why the conditions are checked as a triple.
