#
# Builds the fixture journal twice — without and with the harness's exact
# `ModelSettled.durationMillis` field — scores both, and asserts every reported
# number against `fixtures/mirror-results.json` and the committed codex baseline.
# Then replays the rig's instance guidance and its patch capture over throwaway
# git repositories shaped like the official images, checks that the subject
# fingerprint still names the bytes the CLI actually loads, and replays the
# read-only liveness checker over synthesised journals.
#
# It also pins the two harnesses to one prompt: everything one side is taught and
# the other is not is a variable the comparison does not control.
#
# The best-of-n half is checked the same way: the per-run naming rule, the matrix
# scheduler over a stub harness command, the journal-only selector over two real
# waves, and the report generator over recorded evaluator verdicts.
#
# So is the full benchmark's half that does not need processes: the manifest's
# fold, the resume boundary, and the scoreboard. The half that does —
# pull, extract, delete, kill, resume — is `./fullbench-dryrun.sh`, which needs
# docker and is not run here. The codex backfill splits the same way:
# `./codex-backfill-dryrun.sh` is its process half.
#
# The sealed testbed splits the same way again. The condition, the ledger field
# and the assertion the scoreboard makes out of them are checked here; whether a
# `--network none` container can be `docker exec`-ed into at all, and whether the
# preflight tells an egress-dependent suite from a pre-existing failure, is
# `./network-dryrun.sh`.
#
# The codex arm's lanes are checked here too, because a lane is a claim about
# how a number may be quoted: each one reads its own ledger, no two share an
# archive, an index or an evaluator run id, and the table in the script is the
# table in the README. So is the report that reads the two lanes against each
# other — an `eval error` is never counted as a verdict the seal changed, and
# the seal's own evidence is counted off the transcripts rather than assumed.
#
# The analysis bundle is checked here in full, and the check that matters most is
# what it refuses to print: the gold patch, the graded test file, the
# FAIL_TO_PASS and PASS_TO_PASS identifiers and the maintainer hints are each a
# sentinel in the fixture's dataset row and none may appear in the output. An
# analyst who is handed the answer is not designing a trace a real run could
# follow.
#
# The lock every lane in the rig shares is checked here too — mutual exclusion,
# recovery from a holder killed with -9, and the ownership rule that stops one
# lane freeing another's lock — because a defect there is silent until two
# multi-gigabyte extractions are already running on one disk.
#
# The grader's two rewrites of the official evaluator are checked as well: what
# `SWB_EVAL_EXPORTS` puts inside `eval.sh` and where, and the scoped image
# cleanup that stops one grading deleting another grading's image — the defect
# that produced every r90 `eval error`. So is the re-run: the population it takes
# from the baseline ledger, its scheduler over a stub pipeline, the lane that
# names one whole measurement, and the baseline-vs-re-run comparison.
#
# A programme that has been measured twice needs a third column and a second
# evidence reader, and both are checked here for the same reason the first ones
# were: a miscount in either would be invisible in a report and would read as
# data. `check-three-way.mjs` pins the difference between recovering a verdict
# and gaining one; `check-surgery-evidence.mjs` pins the difference between
# using a stated fact and hunting for it; `check-round3-evidence.mjs` pins the
# difference between a run told its proof was vacuous and a run that then did
# something about it, and between a retry ladder that recovered and one that
# did not; `check-repl-evidence.mjs` pins the difference between a name a realm
# carried across frames and a name that merely appears in two cells, and between
# a call re-issued inside one frame and one re-issued across two;
# `check-prompt-bytes.mjs` pins that an unstated fact is never reported as a
# stated one.
