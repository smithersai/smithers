# on matplotlib__matplotlib-24970, with four `curl https://api.github.com/...`

#
# | value | what codex gets |
# | --- | --- |
# | `on` (default) | the approval/sandbox bypass: host shell, docker, network |
# | `sealed` | the same bypass, with every child command's HTTP proxy pointed at a dead port and the web-search tool off |
# | `off` | codex's own `workspace-write` sandbox, which denies all egress |
#
# **`off` denies more than the network, and that is why `sealed` exists.**
# Measured on codex-cli 0.149.0, 2026-08-22, under `--sandbox workspace-write`:
# a child command cannot reach the docker daemon over its unix socket
# (`permission denied ... unix:///…/docker.sock`), cannot reach a localhost TCP
# relay to it, cannot resolve a name, and cannot open a remote IP. The seatbelt
# policy denies AF_UNIX egress along with everything else, and neither
# `network.allow_unix_sockets` nor the experimental `network_proxy` feature
# changes it from `codex exec`, which has no `--permission-profile` flag. Since
# both arms are told to run the project's tests with
# `docker exec <container> …`, an `off` run cannot run a single test — so an
# `off` arm measures a harness with no web *and* no way to check its work, which
# is two variables at once and not the one this lane is about.
#
# `sealed` removes exactly the web. `shell_environment_policy.set` applies to the
# commands codex spawns and not to codex's own API calls, so the model still
# reaches the API while `curl`, `git`, `pip` and anything that honours the proxy
# environment reach a closed port. Measured the same day, same build:
# `docker exec` exit 0, `curl https://example.com` exit 7,
# `git ls-remote https://github.com/…` exit 128, `urllib.request.urlopen` raises.
# It is a seal on the tools an agent actually reaches for, not a kernel-level
# one: a raw socket, an explicit `--noproxy`, or a `curl` run *inside* the
# testbed container would still get out, and the container keeps the network the
# `on` arm gave it so that test behaviour does not change with the condition. A
# lane that claims a seal therefore has to read its own traces back and say what
# it found; `codex-backfill.sh --lane sealed` records the condition per run.

# Reasoning effort is a benchmark condition, like the network, and it is pinned

# home, whose user config must not decide this benchmark condition.
#
# It was pinned to the literal `medium` from 2026-08-19 to 2026-08-23, under a
# comment saying medium "matches what our harness got as the API default". That
# premise was false. The flows arm has never taken an API default: `effortFor`
# in `packages/smithers/agent/src/AgentSession.ts` returns `high` whenever a flow
# declares no `effort:` frontmatter, `lib/write-flow.mjs` declares none, and
# both have been that way since before wave 1. So every flows wave ran at high
# while every codex lane ran at medium — 45 of 45 transcripts in both
# `fullbench/codex/logs/` and `fullbench/codex-sealed/logs/` carry
# `reasoning effort: medium` — and effort was a variable neither arm's number
# controlled for. Will ruled on 2026-08-23 that the prior results are
# effort-confounded and that the codex arm re-runs at the effort the arm it is
# compared against uses, so the default here is `high`.
#
# A lane that reproduces an older measurement pins its own value instead;
# `codex-backfill.sh` pins one per lane for exactly that reason. The value is
# recorded in the run's timings, and codex echoes it in its own run-log header
# (`reasoning effort: <value>`), so a transcript proves what it ran at.
