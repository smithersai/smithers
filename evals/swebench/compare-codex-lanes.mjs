/**
 * The codex arm twice over one population: with the network, and sealed.
 *
 *   node compare-codex-lanes.mjs [--net f] [--sealed f] [--manifest f] \
 *     [--logs dir] [--out dir] [--label text] [--json]
 *
 * The sealed column is whichever sealed lane the flags point at — `r90s` by
 * default, `r90sh` when the flags name the sealed-high lane — and `--label`
 * names it in the report, because a column rendered under another lane's
 * heading is a number quoted under conditions it was not measured under.
 *
 * `compare-arms.mjs` answers "does flows resolve a superset of what codex
 * resolves", which is a question about two harnesses. This answers a different
 * one about a single harness: **how much of the codex column came from the
 * network.** The `net` lane ran with egress and used it — four
 * `curl https://api.github.com/…` calls read the merged pull request on
 * `matplotlib__matplotlib-24970` — so a column measured against it inherits a
 * caveat that no arithmetic removes. The sealed lane is the same instances, the
 * same model, the same per-instance budget and the same grading rig, with the
 * child commands' HTTP proxy pointed at a closed port.
 *
 * Three rules, each the same one the rest of the rig already obeys:
 *
 * - **A verdict that is not a grading is not a verdict.** `eval error` means the
 *   evaluator never ran the patch. Those rows are named and left out of the
 *   movement sets rather than counted as a loss on either side. `empty patch`
 *   still counts: the agent finished and changed nothing, which is a fact about
 *   the agent.
 * - **Both denominators, always.** `lib/excluded.mjs` names the instances whose
 *   verdicts are statements about the grading environment, and every count here
 *   is printed scored and raw in the same sentence.
 * - **A claimed seal is read back off the traces.** The seal is an environment
 *   one — the proxy variables every child command inherits — not a kernel-level
 *   one, so the report counts, per instance, the egress commands the transcript
 *   contains and the proxy refusals they produced. An instance that attempted
 *   egress is listed by name whatever the outcome, because the reader of a
 *   sealed number is entitled to know where the seal was pushed on.
 * - **A kernel seal is asserted, not described.** From 2026-08-24 a lane may run
 *   its testbed container on `--network none`, and each run records what
 *   `docker inspect` said its container was actually on. A lane whose ledger
 *   claims `none` must observe `none` on every attempted row, retain every
 *   transcript, and show no counted container breaches or web searches, or
 *   `main` exits non-zero. The trace obligations also cover host-side tools
 *   and other containers that the testbed's network observation cannot seal.
 *
 * It reads two codex ledgers, the flows ledger and the sealed lane's own
 * transcripts. No evaluator report, no journal, no clock, no network. Running it
 * twice over the same files produces the same bytes.

 * keeps the network the `net` lane gave it. A `curl` on the far side of a

 *
 * It is reported apart from `attempts` because it is a different finding. An

 * verdict from a run that appears here is not a sealed verdict.
 *
 * The command's own outcome is not read: `docker exec` reports the exit status
 * of the last stage of whatever pipeline it was handed, so a `curl … | head`
