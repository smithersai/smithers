/**
 * Distils the r97 wave's 45 journals into the narrow-only precision fixture.
 *
 *   node lib/r97-narrow-only-journals.mjs [journals-dir] [out-file]
 *
 * Same distillation as lib/narrowing-journals.mjs — every settled call's flow,
 * input and outcome, per-frame digests, transitions — with three additions the
 * r97 measurement needs:
 *
 * - `demands`: every `*-demanded` event the wave recorded, with its seq, so
 *   the replay in `packages/smithers/agent/harness/test/CompletionDemands.test.ts` validates
 *   itself against what the wave really did rather than a memory of it. r97
 *   fired narrow-only five times; three were false positives, and the fixture
 *   is the evidence the fix was measured on.
 * - `prompt`: the flow body each run was handed, re-rendered byte for byte by
 *   lib/write-flow.mjs from the dataset row and the facts the driver log
 *   records (seat `openai:gpt-5.6-sol`, container `flowsbench-<id>-r97`,
 *   test command from lib/test-command.py, interpreter
 *   `/opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python` on all 45 — see
 *   fullbench/rerun-r97/driver.log). `NarrowedCheck.findOnly` reads taught
 *   terms off the run's prefix, so the replay needs the text.
 * - per-call `checkpointed` marks. The journal's `cell-call-started`
 *   projection drops the call's `at`, but a reading pinned to `ctx.base`
 *   never enters the live check ledger, and a replay that folded one in found
 *   narrowings the wave never saw (`psf__requests-2317`). The cell text is
 *   journaled and every r97 cell's calls are plain sequential `await
 *   ctx.call(...)` statements, so source order is runtime order; a
 *   string-aware scan of each cell recovers which calls named an `at`. A cell
 *   this misread would surface as a replay mismatch against `demands`, not
 *   pass silently.
 *
 * Mutating and failed calls carry no `input`: nothing in the completion
 * demands reads one, and dropping them keeps the fixture near the size of its
 * siblings.
 *
 * The fixture is regenerable only while fullbench/rerun-r97/journals and the
 * pinned evaluator venv exist; treat the committed copy as the record.
