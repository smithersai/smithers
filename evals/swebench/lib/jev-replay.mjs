/**
 * Replays the supervisor's reading over archived journals, offline, and scores
 * it against the verdicts the evaluator gave.
 *
 *   node lib/jev-replay.mjs <journals-dir> --manifest <fullbench/manifest.jsonl>
 *       [--suffix -r97] [--limit N] [--json] [--dry-run]
 *
 * The harness asks Jev about a run's shape once per frame, off the cell loop's
 * hot path (`@smthrs/harness` `Supervisor`). Before its nudge is allowed in
 * front of a model, the question is whether the reading predicts anything: a
 * run it calls thrashing or off target should be one the evaluator later marks
 * unresolved, and a run it calls confident should be one it marks resolved.
 * This script builds, for every frame the live supervisor would have been
 * offered, the same `Snapshot` the harness builds, asks the same classifier,
 * and reports precision, recall and F1 against the manifest's verdicts: of
 * `Supervisor.crosses`, the rule `judge` nudges on, and of each of the five
 * `Supervisor.triggers` it is made of, beside the levels and `needs_help`.
 *
 * The snapshot is rebuilt from the journal and not from the harness's memory:
 * `lib/journal-facts.mjs` folds the `control.agent.*` events back into the
 * per-frame ledgers `CellTurn` carried, through the harness's own modules, so
 * a count read here is the count the run had. Three things the archive cannot
 * give are stated rather than guessed at:
 *
 * - `recalled` is empty. Offline there is no memory to recall from, so no
 *   `insert_*` question is asked. `candidates` are read from the frame's
 *   prose exactly as the live supervisor reads them, so the eleven fixed
 *   questions and the same `remember_*` questions are.
 * - `remoteMutations` is zero. The journal records container writes only on
 *   the call that made them, and the r9x waves ran no container-side edits.
 * - `task` is the last system text of the first frame's `model-requested`
 *   record, which is where the run's task segment sits (see `opening` in
 *   `@smthrs/agent` Agent.ts). A journal written before that record existed
 *   has no task text, and its snapshots say so with an empty string rather
 *   than with the dataset's problem statement, which is not what the run read.
 *
 * `--dry-run` builds every snapshot and prints their counts without asking
 * Jev; `fixtures/check-jev-replay.mjs` runs it that way over a synthetic
 * journal. A live run needs `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and reaches the gateway
 * through the same egress client the CLI's own judge uses, at most four
 * requests in flight.
 *
 * A journal is read read-only and never written.
