/**
 * Reads one run's journal back into the facts its controller decided on.
 *
 *   import { read } from "./lib/journal-facts.mjs"
 *   const facts = read("journals/django__django-16612-r3/engine.db")
 *
 * The harness writes every fact a completion is judged on: the input and result
 * of every call, the workspace digest each frame closed on, whether that frame
 * moved the tree, and the transition it applied. This rebuilds the controller's
 * own view out of those events and hands it back — frames, the narrowing ledger,
 * the failure ledger, the demands that were issued, tokens and span.
 *
 * It re-runs no detector of its own. `NarrowedCheck`, `Sufficiency`,
 * `UnresolvedFailure` and `UnmovedTree` are imported from `@smthrs/harness`
 * source and asked the same questions `CellTurn` asks them, in the same order
 * and with the same inputs, so a reading taken here and the demand the run
 * actually got cannot drift apart. Everything this module adds is the fold from
 * an event stream back into per-frame state.
 *
 * Three places where the journal is thinner than the controller's memory, all
 * of them documented here rather than guessed at silently:
 *
 * - **Whether a call declared a write** is per frame in the journal, not per
 *   call. A call is treated as mutating when its flow is one of the editing
 *   flows, which is the same list `lib/narrowing-journals.mjs` and
 *   `fixtures/make-fixture.mjs` use. A misclassification can only drop a check
 *   from the ledger, never add one.
 * - **The call signature** is the canonical form of `[flow, input]` rather than
 *   the controller's digest of it. Both are injective over the same value, so
 *   the equivalence classes — which is all any caller asks about — are identical.
 * - **A call's `invalidProbe`** is read off the reserved result key, as
 *   `CellTurn` reads it: a result carrying an object there is a flow saying the
 *   failure was about the command and not about the tree, and is neither failing
 *   nor passing.
