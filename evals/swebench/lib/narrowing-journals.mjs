/**
 * Distils a wave's journals into the fixture the completion demands replay.
 *
 *   node lib/narrowing-journals.mjs [work-dir] [out-file]
 *
 * The three demands in `@smthrs/harness` that judge a `complete` transition read
 * seven things off a run, and every one of them is already in the journal: the
 * flow and input of every settled call, whether that call succeeded, whether it
 * declared a write, what the call's own result said about its subject's exit
 * status and about whether it ran a check at all, and — per frame — the
 * workspace digest the frame closed on and whether that frame moved the tree.
 * The digest the run *opened* on is read off the `workspace-open` boundary of
 * the first frame. This writes exactly those, so the harness suite can replay a
 * real wave without a database and without the 12 MB of journals that produced
 * it.
 *
 * Three fixtures are committed, and none of them is regenerable:
 *
 * - `packages/smithers/agent/harness/test/fixtures/narrowingJournals.json` — wave 8, the
 *   evidence `NarrowedCheck` was designed against. Wave 9 replaced wave 8's
 *   workspaces, so this file is the last copy of those journals. It predates the
 *   exit-status and mutation fields and is not to be rewritten.
 * - `packages/smithers/agent/harness/test/fixtures/completionJournals.json` — wave 9, the
 *   evidence `UnmovedTree` and `UnresolvedFailure` were designed against.
 * - `packages/smithers/agent/harness/test/fixtures/wave10Journals.json` — wave 10, the first
 *   wave run with all three demands armed, and the evidence
 *   `NarrowedCheck.findOnly` was designed against: its pytest instance ran a
 *   filtered reading of the right file, ran nothing else, and completed, which
 *   is the shape broad-then-narrow cannot see.
 * - `packages/smithers/agent/harness/test/fixtures/vacuousJournals.json` — the r92 full-bench
 *   wave, and the evidence `VacuousVerification` was designed against:
 *   `django__django-14351` stored one verification script as its proof after
 *   having watched that same script exit 0 on the tree it was handed.
 * - `packages/smithers/agent/harness/test/fixtures/r97Journals.json` — the r97 full-bench
 *   wave, written by lib/r97-narrow-only-journals.mjs (a sibling of this
 *   script that also records demand events, the task text, and per-call
 *   checkpoint marks): the evidence the narrow-only demand's taught-terms
 *   condition was measured on.
 *
 * The r92 fixture is the one file here that also carries what a transition
 * stored under `state.verification`, because that is the only thing the newest
 * signal reads which is not already a call.
 *
 * A change to any of the three detectors that starts demanding something of a
 * run those waves resolved has to explain itself against these files rather than
 * against a memory of what a wave once did.
 *
 * `declaredWrites` is per frame rather than per call in the journal, so a call
 * is marked as declaring a write only when its flow is one the wave's own
 * report classes as an edit — the same list `fixtures/make-fixture.mjs` uses.
 * The detectors only ever use the flag to *skip* an entry, so a
 * misclassification here can suppress a demand and cannot invent one.
