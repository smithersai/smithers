# One instance of the full benchmark, from image to verdict to empty disk.
#
#   lib/fullbench-instance.sh <instance_id>
#
# This is the streaming unit `fullbench.sh` schedules two of at a time. It runs
# the whole life of one instance in one process so that nothing multi-gigabyte
# outlives the instance that needed it:
#
#   disk gate -> pull -> disk gate -> run -> archive -> grade -> delete
#
# **Grading happens here, per instance, while the image is still local.** The
# alternative — run all 500, then grade all 500 — needs every image twice and a
# second pass that re-pulls 1.5 TB. Grading one instance the moment its patch
# exists costs one image, once.
#
# Every state it reaches is appended to the manifest before the next one starts,
# so a kill at any point leaves a ledger that says exactly how far this instance
# got. `graded` is the resume boundary: anything short of it re-runs from the
# top on the next start, and this script purges its own instance's artifacts on
# entry so that re-run is clean.
#
# Environment, all set by `fullbench.sh`:
#
#   FB_DIR                        the fullbench directory
#   SWB_FULLBENCH_INDEX           the run index every artifact carries (r90)
#   SWB_FULLBENCH_RUN_ID          the evaluator run id all 500 accumulate into
#   SWB_FULLBENCH_MIN_FREE_MIB    the disk gate, in MiB (8192)
#   SWB_FULLBENCH_DISK_WAIT_MAX   how long the gate may block before giving up
#   SWB_FULLBENCH_DISK_INTERVAL   how often the gate re-checks
#   SWB_FULLBENCH_PINNED          ids whose images are never deleted
#   SWB_SEAT, SWB_FULLBENCH_BUDGET, SWB_MODEL_NAME
#   SWB_FLOWS_OPENAI_AUTH         api-key (default) or chatgpt; run-instance.sh
#                                 reads it from the environment directly
#   SWB_FLOWS_HOST_SHELL          must be `allowed`; run-instance.sh refuses to
#                                 start an agent otherwise, because the flows
#                                 bash flow runs container-less calls on the
#                                 host unconfined. Recorded as `hostShell`
#
# Two stubs exist for the rig's own dry run, and they are the same convention
# `run-matrix.sh` already uses for `SWB_RUN_CMD`:
#
#   SWB_RUN_CMD     replaces the harness run: <cmd> <id> <budget> "" <index>
#   SWB_GRADE_CMD   replaces the evaluator:   <cmd> <run-id> <id>
#   SWB_IMAGE_MAP   a JSON file of id -> image ref, so a dry run can pull a
#                   4 MB image through the real pull/delete path
#
# Exit status: 0 when the instance reached a verdict, non-zero when it did not.
# A harness run that timed out or crashed still reaches a verdict — that is the
# benchmark measuring something — so it is a success here.
