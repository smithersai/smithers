/**
 * Materializes a scorecard fixture from the recorded numbers of a past wave.
 *
 *   node fixtures/make-fixture.mjs [--with-latency]
 *
 * `mirror-results.json` is what the 2026-08-19 overnight wave measured, copied
 * out of the rig's mirror before the scratchpad that held it was wiped. The
 * journals themselves did not survive, so this rebuilds a journal that carries
 * exactly those numbers: the same turns, the same call and refusal counts, the
 * same token totals, over the same span. It is synthetic, and it is the only
 * thing in this directory that is: everything the scorecard then reports is
 * computed by the real reader, the real `Forensics.digest`, and the real price
 * table.
 *
 * `--with-latency` stamps the harness's exact `durationMillis` field onto each
 * model settlement. `verify.sh` builds the fixture both ways to prove the
 * scorecard reports latency when it is there and says so plainly when it is not.
 *
 * Writes work/, patches/, timings/ and one evaluator-shaped report under
 * fixtures/. All of it is generated and gitignored.
