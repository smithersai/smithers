/**
 * Proves `lib/jev-replay.mjs` rebuilds the supervisor's snapshot from a
 * journal, offline, and scores readings the way its report claims.
 *
 *   node fixtures/check-jev-replay.mjs
 *
 * One synthetic journal is written to a temp dir with the `control.agent.*`
 * rows the harness journals: the arming, a first request carrying the task,
 * and seven frames (a read-only frame, an edit, a failing check re-run over
 * the same tree, a completion the claim brake hands back, a rejected cell, a
 * passing check, and a completion that stands). The replay is run in
 * `--dry-run`, so nothing is asked and nothing is spent, and the snapshots are
 * asserted field by field against what `CellTurn` would have offered. The scoreboard is then fed hand-written
 * readings so precision and recall are checked on numbers a person can add up.
 *
 * `jev-gates-journal.json` is then replayed through the command line: two
 * relevance decisions, three monitor readings, one delivery and one restore.
 * The printed withheld, crossing, delivered and resolved rates are asserted,
 * every reading is checked against `Monitor.lint`, and `scorecard.ts` is run
 * over the same journal for its gate counts.
 *
 * Offline, spends nothing, needs no docker.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
