/**
 * The one-lane seal scan, over recorded rows rather than a live daemon.
 *
 * `compare-codex-lanes.mjs` asserts the seal as one column of a two-lane
 * comparison, which is a codex-shaped question. `breach-scan.mjs` asks it of a
 * single lane of **either** arm, because from 2026-08-24 both arms run their
 * testbed on `--network none` and a claim made for one is worth nothing unless
 * the same evidence is produced for the other.
 *
 * What this pins:
 *
 * - **the assertion reads the observation, never the request.** A lane that
 *   asked for `none` and ran on `bridge` fails. A lane with no observation at
 *   all fails the same way, because an unmeasured container is not a sealed one.
 * - **the flows arm's trace is its journal.** A codex run's commands are in its
 *   transcript; a flows run's are in `flows_journal_events.payload_json`, and a
 *   scan that read only the driver's log would clear every flows lane by
 *   looking in the wrong file.
 * - **an untraced instance is a failure, not a pass.** Scanning a missing file
 *   as the empty string is how a lane clears itself by losing its evidence.
 * - **a lane that claims nothing is reported, not graded.** The three lanes
 *   that ran before the field existed render their counts and say outright that
 *   the verdict is not asserted, so an unrecorded lane can never print the word
 *   the sealed lanes earn.
 *
 * The half that needs a real daemon — `docker exec` against a `--network none`
 * container, the inspect readback — is `./network-dryrun.sh`.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
