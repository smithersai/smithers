/**
 * The codex backfill's lanes: one condition, four artifacts, one table.
 *
 * A lane names a whole measurement — the archive, the ledger, the run index, the
 * evaluator run id, and the conditions its runs are given. Moving only some of
 * them would grade one condition's patches into another condition's run id with
 * nothing on disk saying so, which is the same defect `run-45.sh`'s lane exists
 * to prevent on the flows side.
 *
 * Five things are pinned here, all offline:
 *
 * - **a lane reads its own ledger.** The same population, two lanes, two
 *   different remainders: an instance paid for in one lane is still owed in the
 *   other.
 * - **an unknown lane is refused**, rather than silently writing an archive
 *   nothing in the rig knows how to read.
 * - **the table in the script is the table in the README.** A lane added to one
 *   and not the other is a lane an operator cannot find, or a documented lane
 *   that does not exist.
 * - **no two lanes share an artifact.** Two lanes with one index, one ledger,
 *   one archive or one evaluator run id would produce artifacts that cannot be
 *   told apart after the fact.
 * - **no two lanes share a set of conditions, and every lane pins all of
 *   them.** `sealed` and `sealed-high` share a network condition and differ in
 *   effort; `sealed-high` and `none` share a network condition *and* an effort
 *   and differ in the testbed's own network, which is the whole point of the
 *   third one. Two lanes with the same triple would be one measurement under two
 *   names. A lane that left a condition to the runner's default would move when
 *   the default moves — which is exactly what happened to effort on 2026-08-23,
 *   and what the testbed's default did on 2026-08-24 — so all three are written
 *   down per lane.
 *
 * The process half — claims, slots, pulls, grading, deletion — is
 * `./codex-backfill-dryrun.sh`, which needs docker.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
