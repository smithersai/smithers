/**
 * Pins the two harnesses' prompts to one another.
 *
 * The rig's whole claim is that a flows number and a codex number on one
 * instance are the same measurement of two harnesses. That claim is only as good
 * as the prompts: anything one side is taught and the other is not is a variable
 * the comparison does not control, and it will show up in the score as if it
 * were harness quality.
 *
 * The rule this pins is not "the two prompts are identical" — they cannot be,
 * because one names flows' own tools — but **the difference is exactly the tool
 * guidance and nothing else**. The flows-only lines are listed here by hand, so
 * adding a sixth one, or dropping a shared line from one side, fails this check
 * rather than quietly moving the baseline.
 *
 * It is written because that is what happened. On 2026-08-19 the flows prompt
 * started naming the repository's own test runner — `./tests/runtests.py` for
 * Django, `tox` for Sphinx — and the codex prompt kept telling its agent to
 * verify with `python -m pytest`, which neither repository can run. Waves 10 and
 * 11 compared a harness that could check its work against a baseline that could
 * not, on two of five instances, and nothing in the rig said so.
 *
 * Spends no tokens, needs no docker, needs no dataset: the instance row is
 * synthesised here.
