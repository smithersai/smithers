/**
 * Replays the full benchmark's ledger, queue and report over synthesised rows.
 *
 * The driver itself needs docker, an image and a funded key; the three things
 * that decide whether a two-day benchmark is trustworthy do not:
 *
 * - **the ledger's fold** — the last row per instance is that instance's state,
 *   a fresh attempt replaces a dead one's columns, and a line torn by a kill
 *   does not destroy the rows before it;
 * - **the resume boundary** — `graded` and `cleaned` are skipped, everything
 *   else re-runs, and the order is the seeded draw rather than the dataset's;
 * - **the report** — the scoreboard, the Wilson interval, the per-repo
 *   breakdown, the extrapolation, the pinned-five comparison, the exclusions
 *   `lib/excluded.mjs` names and the two denominators that travel with them,
 *   and the append-only checkpoint log.
 *
 * A copied worker rig also pins atomic archive publication and source recovery
 * with failing copy, link and rename commands, without touching real artifacts.
 * `fullbench-dryrun.sh` proves the other half — real pull, real extract, real
 * delete, real kill — for one 4 MB image. This file spends nothing, needs no
 * docker, and needs no dataset.
