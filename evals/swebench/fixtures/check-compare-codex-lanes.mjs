/**
 * Replays the two-codex-lane scoreboard over synthesised ledgers and traces.
 *
 * The question that report answers — how much of the codex column came from the
 * network — has three ways to be answered dishonestly, and all three are pinned
 * here:
 *
 * - **a verdict that is not a grading is not a loss.** An `eval error` in either
 *   lane leaves the movement sets and is named instead. Counting one would
 *   manufacture a "lost with the seal" out of a docker fault, which is the
 *   headline the report exists to state.
 * - **both denominators, always.** `lib/excluded.mjs` keeps two `psf/requests`
 *   rows out of every rate; the scored count and the raw count are printed in
 *   one sentence, and an excluded row is in neither movement set.
 * - **a claimed seal is read back off the traces.** A run that never reached for
 *   the network and a run that reached and was refused are different findings,
 *   so the transcripts are counted rather than assumed, and an instance that
 *   attempted egress is named whatever its verdict. Both surfaces are counted:
 *   the child commands' proxy, and codex's own web-search tool, which no proxy
 *   reaches and which the first r90s attempt left live without noticing.
 * - **the lane the report scores is the lane it names.** The same script reads
 *   whichever sealed lane its flags point at, so an `r90sh` column under the
 *   `r90s` heading would be a number quoted under conditions it was never
 *   measured under.
 *
 * The report is also asserted to be a pure function of its inputs: the same
 * ledgers twice produce the same bytes.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
