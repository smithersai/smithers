# Runs one harness n times over every instance in the seeded sample.
#
#   run-matrix.sh [flows|codex] [count-per-instance] [jobs] [timeout-seconds]
#
# `count-per-instance` attempts of each of the sample's first `SWB_SAMPLE_COUNT`
# instances (5 by default), scheduled `jobs` at a time. `run-matrix.sh flows 5 3`
# is the best-of-5 wave: 25 runs, three of them in flight.
#
# Two rules the scheduler enforces, and one it does not:
#
# - **No two simultaneous runs of the same instance.** They would share one
#   docker image and one image cache, so the second would report a warm pull the
#   first paid for, and — the reason that matters — every live run of an instance
#   keeps an extracted testbed on disk. Interleaving instances bounds the
#   resident set at `jobs` testbeds instead of `count` of the largest one. The
#   schedule is therefore round-major: every instance's r1, then every
#   instance's r2, and a run waits for its own instance's previous attempt.
# - **`jobs` runs in flight, no more.** Same bound `run-sample.sh` applies, for
#   the same reason: the extraction itself is serialized by `run-instance.sh`'s
#   own lock, and what concurrency buys is overlapping the model-bound agent
#   runs.
# - It does **not** stop on a failing run. One instance that times out is a
#   result the matrix is measuring; the manifest records its exit status and the
#   wave continues.
#
# Writes `matrix-<harness>.json`, the manifest the report generator reads: one
# row per run with its id, instance, index, exit status, patch bytes and wall
# clock. `SWB_MATRIX_OUT` overrides the path.
#
# `SWB_RUN_CMD` replaces the per-run command, which is how `fixtures/check-
# matrix.mjs` exercises this scheduler with no docker, no model and no tokens.
# It is called exactly as the real script is: `<cmd> <instance> <a> <b> <index>`.
#
# This spends real API tokens and needs docker. See README.md, "Best-of-n".
