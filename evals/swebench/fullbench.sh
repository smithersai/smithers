# The full SWE-bench Verified benchmark: all 500 instances, one flows attempt
# each, streaming, resumable, and detached.
#
#   ./fullbench.sh                 start a new benchmark
#   ./fullbench.sh --resume        continue the one already in fullbench/
#   ./fullbench.sh --foreground    run in this process (the rig's own tests)
#   ./fullbench.sh --stop          ask a running driver to stop after its
#                                  in-flight instances finish
#   ./fullbench.sh --clear-pause   remove a PAUSED marker so --resume can start
#   ./fullbench.sh --aggregate     write the evaluator's own report over every
#                                  instance graded so far (spends nothing)
#
# Detached launch, exactly. Copy this line:
#
#   cd evals/swebench && mkdir -p fullbench \
#     && nohup ./fullbench.sh --resume >> fullbench/launch.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
#
# The `mkdir` is not optional on a rig that has never run one: the shell opens
# the redirect before it runs anything, so without the directory the line fails
# and no driver starts. `nohup` detaches it from the terminal, and this script
# then double-forks itself — `( worker & )` runs the worker in a subshell that
# exits immediately, so the worker is reparented to launchd — which is what
# makes it survive the session that launched it, not just the terminal. The launcher prints the
# worker's pid and exits; everything after that is in `fullbench/driver.log`.
#
# What it does, per instance, two at a time:
#
#   wait for 8 GiB free -> pull -> run one attempt -> grade THAT instance now,
#   while its image is still local -> archive journal, patch and report ->
#   delete the testbed and the image
#
# The image is the reason for the shape. 500 official images are about 1.5 TB
# and this machine has 16 GiB to spare, shared with the 5x5 best-of-n matrix, so
# nothing multi-gigabyte may outlive the instance that needed it. The five
# images that matrix pinned are never deleted.
#
# Resume is a ledger, not a checkpoint: `fullbench/manifest.jsonl` records every
# state every instance reaches, fsynced before the next one starts. A restart
# skips every instance whose last state is `graded` and re-runs everything else
# from the top, cleanly. A crash mid-instance therefore costs that instance and
# nothing else.
#
# This spends real API tokens. See README.md, "The full benchmark".
