# The re-run: the r90 baseline's 45 instances, once each, on today's harness.
#
#   ./run-45.sh                 start (or continue) the re-run, detached
#   ./run-45.sh --foreground    run in this process (the rig's own tests)
#   ./run-45.sh --list          the instances it still owes, and stop
#   ./run-45.sh --status        counts, and stop
#   ./run-45.sh --stop          ask a running driver to stop after its
#                               in-flight instances finish
#   ./run-45.sh --limit N       schedule at most N instances this session
#   ./run-45.sh --lane NAME     name the lane: ledger, archive, artifact index
#                               and evaluator run id all derive from it
#
# ## The lane
#
# A lane is one measurement of the population on one subject. `--lane r92`
# writes `fullbench/rerun-r92/`, indexes artifacts `r92`, and grades into the
# evaluator run id `rerun-r92`. The default is `r91`, the first re-run, so an
# operator who names no lane resumes that one rather than starting a nameless
# sixth. Every subcommand takes it, because `--status` on the wrong lane reads
# the wrong ledger. `SWB_RERUN_LANE` sets it from the environment; `FB_DIR`,
# `SWB_RERUN_INDEX` and `SWB_RERUN_RUN_ID` still override the three values it
# derives, one at a time, for the rig's own tests.
#
# `analysis/PROGRAM.md` names eleven harness changes and, for each, a falsifiable
# prediction about what the same 45 instances would then cost. This is the
# measurement those predictions are settled against. It is the *only* thing that
# settles them: an argument that a change helps is not a number.
#
# ## What is held fixed
#
# Everything except the harness. The comparison is worthless otherwise, so the
# knobs are not knobs:
#
# | | r90 baseline | this re-run |
# | --- | --- | --- |
# | instances | 45, seeded draw order | **the same 45**, same order, read out of the baseline ledger |
# | attempts per instance | one | one |
# | per-instance budget | 1200 s | 1200 s |
# | seat | `openai:gpt-5.6-sol` | `openai:gpt-5.6-sol` |
# | journals | archived per instance | archived per instance |
# | testbeds and images | deleted after the verdict | deleted after the verdict |
# | grading | official evaluator, x86_64 images | the same, plus the rig fixes in `lib/grade.py` |
# | in flight | 2 | 3 |
# | authoring surface | the filing surface | the persistent realm, which is the only one there is |
#
# ## The surface
#
# There is no arm to select. Every run holds one persistent realm for its whole
# life — a cell's top-level names are still bound in the next cell,
# `console.log` is the channel to the next model turn, and the run ends at
# `ctx.done`/`ctx.park` rather than at a returned object
# (`docs/specs/Concepts/Repl Realm.md`). The filing surface this replaced was
# deleted on 2026-08-24 as a design error, so `FLOWS_CELL_MODE` selects nothing
# and no longer exists. Every lane runs the same 45 instances in the same order
# at the same seat and the same budgets, and the task prompt is byte-identical:
# `lib/write-flow.mjs` is not a knob.
#
# Two of those rows deserve their reason stated rather than assumed.
#
# **The instance list is derived, never typed.** `lib/rerun-queue.mjs` takes the
# ids the baseline ledger actually graded and orders them by the same seeded
# draw. There is no flag that adds or drops one, so a re-run cannot quietly
# become a re-run of an easier set.
#
# **Three in flight rather than two.** This changes wall-clock *scheduling*, not
# what any instance is measured at: `lib/fullbench-instance.sh` gives every
# instance its own container, its own testbed and its own 1200 s budget, and the
# numbers this benchmark compares — dollars, frames, and the agent's own span —
# are per-instance and never wall-clock-of-the-whole-run. What three does change
# is disk: three testbeds plus three images against the same 8 GiB gate, which is
# why the gate is still there and still blocks. Set `SWB_RERUN_JOBS=2` to hold
# even this fixed.
#
# **The grading rig is fixed, and that is on purpose.** `lib/grade.py` now scopes
# the evaluator's image cleanup so one grading cannot delete another's image
# (which is what produced every r90 `eval error`), and `evaluate.sh` serves the
# psf/requests family a local httpbin (which is what produced two false
# `unresolved`s). Compare against the *re-graded* baseline — `./regrade.sh` has
# already written those verdicts into `fullbench/manifest.jsonl` — so the
# denominator is the same rig on both sides.
#
# ## Where it writes
#
# Its own ledger and archive, under `fullbench/rerun-<lane>/`, so the baseline's
# `fullbench/manifest.jsonl` is never appended to and stays exactly what
# `compare-runs.mjs` compares against. Artifacts carry the lane as their index
# and grade into the evaluator run id `rerun-<lane>`. One lane never writes into
# another's ledger, which is what makes a second measurement of the same 45
# instances a second measurement rather than an append to the first.
#
# Resume is the ledger, as the full benchmark's is: an instance whose last row is
# `graded` or `cleaned` is skipped and everything else re-runs from the top.
#
# One stub exists for the rig's own tests, the same convention
# `lib/fullbench-instance.sh` already uses for `SWB_RUN_CMD` and `SWB_GRADE_CMD`:
#
#   SWB_RERUN_INSTANCE_CMD   replaces the per-instance pipeline: <cmd> <id>
#
# With it, `fixtures/check-run-45.mjs` drives the whole scheduler — concurrency,
# resume, the budget gate, `--stop`, `--limit` — with no docker and no tokens.
#
# This spends real API tokens — budget roughly the baseline's $37.84, less if the
# program's changes work. See README.md, "The re-run".
