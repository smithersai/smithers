/**
 * The subject under evaluation: the Smithers agent, composed the way a host
 * composes it.
 *
 * The behaviour under evaluation is production code: the cell controller and
 * its loop, the QuickJS sandbox, the registry-backed call bridge, the
 * structured-output boundary, and the seat seam are the same objects a real
 * host wires. What the suite supplies around them is stated rather than
 * implied. Execution runs on `FlowEngine.layerMemory`, the engine's in-process
 * volatile runtime, not the durable SQLite one a deployed host uses. The
 * `Model` behind `SeatResolver` answers with recorded cells instead of
 * streaming from a provider, the `Route` it seals against never leaves the
 * process, and the `Registry` is an empty one this file builds. That is what
 * makes the suite offline, deterministic, and safe to run in CI with no API
 * key, and it is also the boundary of what a green run proves: the loop and its
 * seams, not durability and not a real catalog.
 *
 * Two entry points, because the agent has two public ways in and both are worth
 * measuring. {@link runAction} drives it through `AgentAction` — one typed step
 * inside an ordinary flow, with a declared output schema the answer must
 * satisfy. {@link runAgent} drives the `Agent` service directly inside a real
 * flow execution, which is how a scenario reaches an option `AgentAction` does
 * not forward, such as `readOnlyCap`.
 *
 * Imports reach the workspace packages by relative path because the repository
 * root does not depend on `@smthrs/agent`; pnpm resolves each package's
 * internal dependencies to the same realpaths, so module identity holds.

 * while nothing has been written, passing once something has. The one exception
 * is `only: "green"`, which passes whatever the run has done — a check with no
 * failing side, which is what a vacuous proof is made of.

 * compensation seam — this composition has none, and a run that asked for one
