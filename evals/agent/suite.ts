/**
 * The fixed suite: seventeen scenarios that put the Smithers agent through the
 * behaviours a host depends on, and the two scorers that grade them.
 *
 * Each scenario is a whole agent run against a scripted provider, so a case is
 * not a prompt-response fixture — it is one execution of the production loop
 * under a stated host composition, reduced to an {@link Subject.Observation}.
 * The `expected` value on a case is that observation written out in full, which
 * is why a failing case names the behaviour that changed rather than a number
 * that moved.
 *
 * Two scorers grade every case, and they are independent on purpose. `behaviour`
 * asks whether the run did what the case declares. `contract` asks whether the
 * observation is well formed at all: it decodes against the declared schema and
 * then holds the invariants that schema cannot state, so a scenario that
 * reduced its run into a contradictory observation fails the second scorer even
 * when the first happens to compare equal.
