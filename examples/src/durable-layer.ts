 * from a stale owner. `Ownership.sameHostPidProbe` asks this machine's process
 * table, so a second process over the same file cannot take a run out of a
 * live one; a run recorded on another host is left to the lease. A stub that
 * returns `false` without asking is the one thing a real deployment must not
 * do: it says "that owner is gone" about an owner it never looked at.
 *
 * `OwnerIdentity.layer` is the default owner minter: the process id plus a
