/**
 * Run a scripted agent with filesystem tools inside a bounded QuickJS cell loop.
 *
 * The cell reaches tools through registered flows. The host supplies a
 * capability envelope, the sandbox limits cell evaluation, and durable call
 * boundaries record tool outcomes for replay.
 *
 * Only read/write flows are exposed, with capabilities scoped to the scratch
 * root and a host service that resolves relative paths there and rejects
 * absolute paths, traversal and links. The host must exclusively own the tree
 * during the run; this is not an OS boundary against concurrent host mutations.
 * The scripted seat makes the test deterministic and requires no API key.
