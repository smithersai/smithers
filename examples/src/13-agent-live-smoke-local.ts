 * Run a model-backed action against a local Ollama endpoint.

 * The composition uses `Route.openaiChatCompatible` with a local model server.
 * Start Ollama and download the model configured by the example before running
 * it. `main` accepts the server base URL and defaults to
 * `http://localhost:11434`.
 *
 * This example needs a running local model; it is not a deterministic substitute
 * for the scripted-model tests.
 *
 * The test requires explicit opt-in even when Ollama is running. From
 * `examples/`, run
 * `SMITHERS_LIVE_EXAMPLES=1 pnpm exec vitest run test/13-agent-live-smoke-local.test.ts`.
 * It allows 300 seconds and skips with a reason if the daemon or model is missing.
