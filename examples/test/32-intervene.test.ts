 * d54180b9fe added the advisory `capability_outside_grant` code. `Intervene.make`
 * composes the step flows without restating their capabilities, so the composed
 * plan grants nothing and every step that names one is reported. That is the
 * intended reading of the new code, pinned the same way in
 * `packages/smithers/flows/patterns/test/Sidecar.test.ts`, so these tests now pin which steps
 * are reported instead of denying that any are, and still assert that nothing
 * fatal reaches the plan.
