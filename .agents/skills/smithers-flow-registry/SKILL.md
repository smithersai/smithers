# Flow registry

Read [the registry README](../../../packages/smithers/agent/registry/README.md) and [filesystem router README](../../../packages/smithers/agent/fs/README.md) before changing discovery or command projection. A flow directory has one entry file: `flow.ts`, `flow.mdx`, or `SKILL.md`; the descriptor records source and digest without importing its body. Registry `list` and `warnings` read one metadata snapshot. Do not execute a discovered flow to answer a catalog listing.

Executable registration is a separate boundary that loads the selected body, resolves its delegate, and supplies runtime layers. Preserve warning receipts for refusals and the refresh path for edited entries. A host must provide services required by delegate success/error codecs even when the catalog erases their static requirements. Pack entries retain provenance and path confinement; verify name precedence, stale descriptors, and an edit during refresh in tests.

`@smthrs/fs` command listing is metadata-only, but its first Incur help/OpenAPI/MCP projection imports visible modules to publish input schemas. Keep that distinction explicit when claiming a discovery path runs no user code.
