# Smithers integrations

Read [the integrations README](../../../packages/smithers/agent/integrations/README.md) and the provider's tests before changing a client, action, or webhook. Outbound write calls may have acted even when a 5xx or connection loss hides the answer: report `outcomeUnknown` rather than retrying an ambiguous write. Rate-limit refusals may retry. Durable provider actions are irreversible flow actions; preserve the journal receipt and do not claim a remote side effect is atomically rolled back.

For inbound webhooks, the receiver caps body size before `Channels.ingest`; the channel then verifies, decodes, maps, and dispatches. Put a provider delivery identity in `RawInbound.idempotencyKey` or redelivery has no replay protection. Test duplicate deliveries and an ambiguous outbound response. Telegram long messages are chunked across multiple calls; a partial failure must retain which earlier chunks were sent.
