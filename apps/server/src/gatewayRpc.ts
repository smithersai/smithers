/*
 * The RPC framing the relay speaks to the workspace gateway.
 *
 * The browser cannot hold the gateway credential, so every call goes through
 * this Worker. The Worker takes the product's own envelope — a repo, a
 * procedure name, and a payload — and writes the gateway's newline-delimited
 * RPC frame for it. That keeps the browser free of the wire format and keeps
 * the procedure visible on this side, which is what makes the allowlist and
 * the replay decision possible at all: a Worker that forwarded an opaque body
 * could not tell a run listing from a launch.
 *
 * Frame shapes, read off a live rc.0 gateway:
 *
 *   request  {"_tag":"Request","id":1,"tag":"List","payload":{…},"headers":[]}
 *   success  {"_tag":"Exit","requestId":1,"exit":{"_tag":"Success","value":…}}
 *   failure  {"_tag":"Exit","requestId":1,"exit":{"_tag":"Failure","cause":[…]}}
 *
 * A failure `cause` is Effect's array of reasons — `{_tag:"Fail",error}`,
 * `{_tag:"Die",defect}`, `{_tag:"Interrupt",fiberId}` (`ExitEncoded` in
 * `effect/unstable/rpc/RpcMessage`) — and `gatewayRpc.test.ts` pins that shape
 * against the installed codec.
 */

/**
 * Where each relayed procedure is mounted on the gateway.
 *
 * `Plan`, `Run`, `Cancel`, `Resume`, `Steer`, `Signal`, and `List` are
 * `@smthrs/control` `ControlRpcs` at `/rpc`. `Projection.Snapshot` and
 * `Approval.Submit` are `@smthrs/gateway` `GatewayRpcs` at `/projections`.
 *
 * This is the product floor and no more: every procedure here has a caller in
 * `apps/app`, and the relay carries the server-held gateway credential, so
 * mounting a procedure before a product call needs it widens what a
 * compromised browser session can reach for nothing. `Approve` and `Deny`
 * stay out — a decision crosses as the gateway's `Approval.Submit`, which
 * carries the payload the projection published back unchanged.
 *
 * The two streaming procedures (`Watch`, `Projection.Subscribe`) are
 * deliberately absent for a different reason: a stream belongs on the
 * gateway's separately authenticated WebSocket mounts, not on this product
 * Worker's request/response route. The product's old deployment-identity raw
 * proxy was removed; it is not a streaming escape hatch.
