/**
 * The cloud roles: turns the Worker answers itself, on Cerebras.
 *
 * A turn body may name the role it wants answered by (`role`, AgentRoles.ts).
 * Most roles are hints the chat upstream maps to a model. A CLOUD role
 * (`librarian`, `flows`; CLOUD_AGENT_ROLES) is different: this Worker holds
 * the deployment's own Cerebras key, and these roles are all that spend it
 * (the composer pills and the front door are Jev's, with no Cerebras path at
 * all: src/recommend.ts), so the turn
 * is served here, on the free Cerebras seat, and never reaches the chat
 * upstream. That makes "the Librarian and the Flows agent run on Cerebras"
 * a fact this repository tests instead of a hint an upstream may ignore.
 *
 * What a cloud role turn is NOT: it carries no tools and no tool-loop
 * continuation items, because a Cerebras chat completion is one sealed
 * answer; a body that carries either is refused with 400, as the model relay
 * refuses tool-bearing author calls. It holds no cancel-registry entry: the
 * completion is one bounded call, so there is nothing a kill could interrupt
 * and a cancel answers an honest not-found. The router spends the same
 * ceilings before calling here that it spends on an upstream turn (the
 * login's, or the anonymous address and deployment buckets), so a visitor's
 * twenty questions a day are twenty whether Smithers or the Librarian
 * answers.
 *
 * The client going away is the fiber's interruption (src/Boundary.ts): it
 * aborts the provider call and the boundary answers 499, so nothing here
 * watches a signal.
 *
 * First cut: one non-streaming completion becomes one text delta and one
 * done frame, tagged with the body's runId like every other turn stream.
 * Translating the provider's SSE stream into deltas is a follow-up.
