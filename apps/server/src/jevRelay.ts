/**
 * POST /api/jev: one Jev evaluation, relayed.
 *
 * The browser holds no gateway key and must not: the key is the
 * deployment's. Every in-app decision whose answer set can be enumerated is
 * Jev's, so the browser needs one door to the same client the recommender
 * and the front door already call, and this is it. The route carries a
 * request and its answers through unchanged; it decides nothing, stores
 * nothing, and logs nothing.
 *
 * The body is `{ state, questions }` — a `JevRequest` without its model,
 * because the model is the deployment's to choose. Bounds are the
 * recommender's: the same byte cap before parsing, the same 255 options in
 * one choice question, and the same deadline, so a timeout message here
 * names the number it actually waited.
 *
 * The ceiling is the recommender's too, spent under `recommendKey`, so every
 * Jev decision an address or a login asks for comes out of one daily budget
 * rather than one budget per caller. The route is open to a signed-out
 * visitor, as the recommender is, because a visitor's first minutes in the
 * product are exactly when its decisions matter.
 *
 * A Jev that refuses, misses its deadline or answers something unreadable is
 * a `service_temporarily_unavailable` 503 naming the reason, and an unset
 * key is a `seam_not_configured` 503. There is no second model and no
 * heuristic behind this route: a caller reads the refusal and fails.
