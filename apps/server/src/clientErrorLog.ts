/**
 * A readable record of what broke in a user's browser.
 *
 * The client already posts its errors to `/api/client-errors`. Until now the
 * handler ran `console.error` and stopped, which means the report survived only
 * as long as someone happened to be running `wrangler tail`. During a private
 * alpha that is the same as having no report at all: the first anyone learns of
 * a broken flow is the user mentioning it, if they bother.
 *
 * So the last reports are kept in one Durable Object — a ring buffer, newest
 * first — and read back through `GET /api/admin/errors`, behind the same admin
 * validation as every other admin route. Deliberately not a log service: no new
 * vendor, no new secret, no egress, and it is bounded, so it cannot grow into a
 * cost of its own.
 *
 * What is stored is what the page sent plus when it arrived, the URL it came
 * from, the user agent, and whether the request carried a session cookie. No
 * session lookup: identifying the reporter would mean an identity round-trip
 * on a route that must stay cheap enough to absorb an error storm, and the
 * report itself is what needs reading.
 *
 * The route is unauthenticated by design (a crash before or during sign-in
 * must still be recorded), so the throttle is the only thing between an
 * anonymous flood and the log. It lives HERE, in the one Durable Object every
 * report reaches, and not in the Worker: a counter in Worker module state is
 * per isolate, workerd runs many isolates and recycles them, and so a counter
 * there bounds nothing. The window is global, one source gets a small share
 * of it, and a report that came with a session cookie is never evicted to
 * make room for one that did not.
