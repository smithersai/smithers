 * `RequireScope` in plue internal/middleware/scope.go builds it at one line
 * (`errors.Forbidden("insufficient token scope")`) and plue's own suite pins
 * the string (internal/routes/regression_test.go, internal/middleware/
 * admin_test.go). Reading it is still reading a sentence, which is why it is
 * only ever consulted INSIDE a body that already carried plue's typed
 * `forbidden` verdict — see `isCloudScopeRefusal`.

 *
 * The verdict comes off the wire: plue serializes `code` first and clients
 * branch on it, never on `message` (plue pkg/errors/errors.go `APIError`). A
 * body with no plue code — Cloudflare's own block page, another proxy's
 * envelope, a string that merely reads like a scope complaint — cannot
 * publish a signed-in session, whatever English it contains.
 *
 * plue's taxonomy has no code for "this token's scopes are short": the scope
 * gate, the workspaces feature flag, and the repository-bound-token gate all
 * answer `forbidden`, so the code alone cannot separate them and the pinned
 * sentence above picks the scope one out. That is the producer's gap, and
 * fixing it is a change in plue: give `RequireScope` its own registry code
 * (pkg/errors/registry.go) and this function becomes the code test alone.
