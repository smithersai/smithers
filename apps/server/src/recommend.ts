/**
 * The command recommender: which `/command` should this user run next?
 *
 * The browser posts the tail of the current chat and every command the user
 * can invoke right now, and this route answers an ordered list of up to five
 * of those commands. Jev, a decision model that picks among named options and
 * reports a probability for each, is the only model this route asks. There is
 * no Cerebras path for pills: when Jev is unavailable the route refuses, and
 * an LLM is never asked in its place. A catalog too long for one choice
 * question is split across several questions in ONE request — the gateway
 * answers them in parallel — and their probabilities are merged, so size is
 * never a reason to ask someone else. The client renders the answer as pills
 * under the composer. The route works for a signed-out visitor as well as a
 * login, because the pills are how a visitor learns what the product can do.
 *
 * Every recommendation is a row in a bounded log (one Durable Object for the
 * deployment), and when the user runs a command next the client posts the
 * outcome under the recommendation's id. That pair is the whole eval: a hit
 * is an outcome that was on the list, a top-1 is an outcome that was first.
 * The log never holds the chat text, only a digest of it, so a scorer can
 * tell two tails apart without reading either.
 *
 * Honesty rules the answers. A hallucinated command name is dropped, never
 * shown. An unset `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is a `seam_not_configured` 503; a Jev
 * that refuses, times out or answers something unreadable is a
 * `service_temporarily_unavailable` 503 naming what went wrong. Never a
 * made-up list, and never a second model: the client's rule-based pills are
 * the client's business, and the log must only ever hold what Jev said.
 *
 * `cerebrasChat` below is NOT part of this route. It is the Worker's one
 * Cerebras client, and the cloud roles (cloudRoleTurn.ts: the Librarian, the
 * Flows agent) spend it. Those are LLM roles a user asked for, not a fallback
 * for a decision Jev owes.
