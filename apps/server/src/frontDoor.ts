/**
 * The front door: Jev decides the turn before the concierge is paid for it.
 *
 * "The decision model Jev is the main model and it just happens to decide we
 * should utilize an llm sometimes." Every chat message now reaches Jev first.
 * When the message IS, with high confidence, one of the commands this client
 * can run right now, this Worker answers the turn itself with the same frames
 * the concierge would have emitted for that command — so the browser's own
 * execution boundary opens the command's form or runs it — and no chat turn
 * is spent. Below the floor, or on `none`, the turn goes upstream to the
 * concierge: that is Jev deciding, and the concierge is what it decided on.
 *
 * A Jev that FAILS is not that. There is no fallback: an unset
 * `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, a refused gateway, a missed deadline or an answer
 * this client cannot read refuses the turn with the same typed failures a
 * cloud role turn uses for an unavailable model (cloudRoleTurn.ts), and the
 * chat upstream is never spent instead. The main model being down is an
 * outage the client is told about, not a silent downgrade to an LLM.
 *
 * Three things make the routing honest rather than clever.
 *
 * The catalog is DATA. The offered commands ride the turn body
 * (`StartAgentTurnRequest.commands`, the same `{ name, summary }` list the
 * recommender posts), never parsed back out of the system prompt. Its size
 * never decides anything: a catalog longer than one choice question holds is
 * split across the questions of ONE request, under the boolean gate that
 * holds those questions together (`askFrontDoor`).
 *
 * The frames are the CLIENT's own contract, not a new one. A routed turn is
 * one `tool_call` frame naming the one tool the model has (`commands`) with
 * `{"action":"execute","name":"<command>"}` and NO args, then `done` with
 * reason `tool_call`. The client already handles exactly that
 * (apps/app controller/turns.ts subscribeToAgent, HttpTurn.ts
 * projectHttpFrame): it executes the call through the registry — which
 * renders the flow's form when a required argument is missing, and runs the
 * command when none is — and then POSTs a continuation leg carrying the
 * function_call / function_call_output pair.
 *
 * That continuation is the one place the protocol forces a choice: the client
 * MUST post it. So the call id this module mints is prefixed (`frontdoor-`,
 * spelled in @smthrs/rpc NativeAgent so both halves read one constant), the
 * prefix round-trips through the client untouched, and a continuation whose
 * trailing call carries it is answered here too — with `done` and nothing
 * else. The answer is the act: the client records the registry's own honest
 * result line ("Smithers ran /runs.list", or the refusal it really got) as
 * this turn's assistant words, so the transcript keeps one line that is both
 * what the user reads and what every later turn's model reads. No claim about
 * run state is invented, and the deterministic claim surface (RunClaims.ts)
 * still owns a launch turn's prose. A client that forges the prefix buys
 * itself a turn that says nothing, no model call and no ceiling it had not
 * already spent.
 *
 * Privacy: the tail already goes to Jev for the composer's pills under zero
 * data retention, and it rides the same way here. The turn's hidden runtime
 * `context` does NOT: only the active repository's name, validated as
 * "owner/name", leaves with the conversation tail.
