/**
 * A per-login ceiling on model calls, because every one of them spends model
 * dollars.
 *
 * The unit is ONE CALL TO A MODEL-SPENDING ROUTE, not one thing the user typed.
 * That distinction became load-bearing when the browser Agent Chain became the
 * only chat backend: the loop runs in the page and authors a fresh link over
 * `/api/model/stream` for each step of a turn, bounded at 32 links, so one
 * message can spend many units where the old server-side turn spent exactly
 * one. The ceiling below is sized in those units.
 *
 * Chat is complimentary during the alpha (DESIGN.md §1): a $0 balance never
 * pauses the composer, and the zero-balance guard in the client covers workflow
 * launch, not chat. That is a deliberate product decision and this module does
 * not touch it. What it adds is the thing a comped seam has no other defence
 * against: a runaway client, a stuck retry loop, or a lifted session cookie can
 * post turns as fast as the network allows, and the first anyone would know is
 * the invoice.
 *
 * So this is an ABUSE ceiling, not a billing pause. It sits far above what a
 * person chatting hard reaches in an hour, and its refusal says so — an alpha
 * user who trips it has hit a bug, not a paywall, and must never be told to go
 * buy something.
 *
 * The state is one Durable Object per login, keyed by the validated login only:
 * a client cannot name its own bucket. Fixed windows, not a rolling log — the
 * ceiling is loose enough that the boundary effect (up to 2x across a window
 * edge) does not matter, and one counter is far cheaper than a timestamp list.
 */

/**
 * Model calls one login may start per window.
 *
 * A heavy hour of conversation is about sixty messages, and a chain turn
 * authors a handful of links for each — so sixteen calls a message is already a
 * pessimistic reading of a hard hour. A thousand keeps the same ten-times
 * headroom the ceiling has always had, and still stops a lifted cookie posting
 * as fast as the network allows: at the alpha's rate card a spent window is
 * about a dollar, which is a bug someone notices rather than an invoice nobody
