/*
 * The generic flow triggers of one repository, as the browser reaches them:
 * the three `/api/workflow/trigger-*` routes of L36 §1.5 (E9, E10, E11).
 *
 * A generic trigger is a repository job whose key is `flow:<slug>` — a
 * namespace disjoint from the five built-in jobs, which carry no colon. The
 * registration itself is written by the workspace host through the gateway
 * bearer (E1); a browser can never hold that credential, so these routes are
 * the read, the stop, and the approval receipt, each under the workflow
 * session gate and each spending the caller's own Cloud token.
 *
 * The listing parses EACH ROW ON ITS OWN and drops what it does not
 * recognise. A foreign registration — one of the five built-ins, a row a
 * later Plue writes, a row past this Worker's vocabulary — never fails the
 * listing, and the five setup jobs' own recovery (repositorySetupRecovery.ts)
 * is a separate reader that this file never touches.
