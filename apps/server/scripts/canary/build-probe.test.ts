/**
 * CN-1's propagation window.
 *
 * On 2026-09-14 the autodeploy runner deployed 83a400d9, probed
 * canary.smithers.sh four seconds later, read the previous build's stamp
 * (22316c30) and rolled the good deploy back; smithers.sh, probed seconds
 * after that, already served the new one. The deployment was right and the
 * probe was early, so these tests fix both halves of the contract: a
 * disagreement that resolves inside the window is not a verdict, and a
 * disagreement that outlives the window still is.
 *
 * The loop's clock, sleep and fetch are injected, so a ninety-second window
 * runs in no time and never touches the network. The shell tests below spawn
 * the real probe against a loopback stand-in whose answers change between
 * reads, which is the race itself in miniature.
