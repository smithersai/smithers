 *
 * Every request is an anonymous GET of a static asset or a public read, so a
 * run costs nothing and spends no model turn. Redirects are not followed by
 * the fetch: a redirect is graded as a hop, and a legacy alias may take a
 * bounded chain of them before it must answer 200.
 *
 * The verdicts live in site-checks.ts, which is covered by site-checks.test.ts.
 * The fetch below is the one line no test reaches.
