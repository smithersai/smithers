/*
 * CN-18: the backing services answer a health probe.
 *
 *   bun scripts/canary/workers-health.ts [--timeout <ms>]
 *
 * apps/app/scripts/canary-seam-probe.ts already probes the seams THROUGH the
 * product Worker, which is the right test for "is the product honest about its
 * upstreams". It cannot tell a healthy upstream from a proxy that never called
 * one, and it says nothing at all about the five Workers apps/server does not
 * proxy (connectors-catalog, cron, status, sync, webhooks). This probe is the
 * other half: it calls each Worker directly, at its own origin, with no
 * credential. When both pass, the seam and the service behind it are both good;
 * when this one fails and the seam probe passes, the product is masking an
 * outage.
 *
 * Three states per Worker, never conflated:
 *
 *   healthy         it answered its contract (see workers-manifest.ts).
 *   unhealthy       it answered wrongly, answered 5xx, or did not answer.
 *   not-configured  this deployment declares it unset ($CANARY_WORKER_ORIGINS).
 *                   Not a failure — canary-seam-probe.ts models the same
 *                   honesty for the deliberately-unset gateway seam.
 *
 * Exit 1 when any Worker is unhealthy, and also when NOTHING was configured — a
 * run that asserted nothing must not report PASS. Exit 2 when the probe could
 * not run at all, which is a different fact from a Worker being down.

 *

 * varying only the request headers:
 *
 *   json   What THIS probe receives, because it sends `accept: application/json`
 *          and a compressed encoding. An RFC 9457 problem document that names
 *          itself: `"cloudflare_error": true`, a `type` under
 *          developers.cloudflare.com, and the triple `"error_code": 1042`,
 *          `"error_name": "workers_dev_script_not_found"`, `"ray_id"`. Any one
 *          of those three signals is conclusive on its own.
 *   plain  `error code: NNNN` and nothing else. What an uncompressed non-browser
 *          request gets, and the historical shape most Cloudflare documentation
 *          still shows.
 *   page   HTML. Two generations are in service: the classic branded error page,
 *          keyed by the `cf-error-details` and `cf-error-code` hooks Cloudflare's
 *          own stylesheet targets, and the newer workers.dev "Page not found"
 *          page, which carries no error code and is keyed by its title together
 *          with the workers.cloudflare.com favicon it loads. The classic page is
 *          what the edge serves for WAF and rate-limit blocks, which arrive as
 *          403 and 429 — statuses a responds Worker is otherwise allowed to
 *          answer with.
 *
 * Keyed on the shape and on Cloudflare's self-identification, never on a
 * particular error number: Cloudflare assigns a code per failure mode and adds
 * new ones, but every code is rendered through these templates. Every match is
 * anchored — the plain form must be the entire body, and the JSON form must be
 * a top-level object with an edge-authored field — so a Worker that quotes the
 * phrase inside a larger message is not mistaken for the edge.
