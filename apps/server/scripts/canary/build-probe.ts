/*
 * CN-1: the deployed bundle is the git sha the deploy receipt claims.
 *
 *   bun scripts/canary/build-probe.ts [origin] [--sha <sha>] [--receipt <path>]
 *                                     [--max-drift <n>] [--json <path>]
 *                                     [--allow-unstamped-html]
 *                                     [--settle-ms <n>] [--settle-interval-ms <n>]
 *
 * Reads the build stamp the deployment carries (the site build writes it,
 * apps/site/scripts/build-stamp-integration.ts over apps/app/scripts/build-stamp.ts)
 * and compares it with the sha the caller expects. No credential is needed:
 * the stamp is a static asset on a public deployment.
 *
 * Expected sha resolution, first hit wins: --sha, $CANARY_EXPECTED_SHA,
 * --receipt <path>, then ../../deploy-receipts/latest.json when it exists.
 * Receipts are gitignored, so a scheduled run usually resolves none; that
 * check then prints as skipped, never as a pass.
 *
 * PROPAGATION. A Worker version reaches every edge seconds after
 * `wrangler deploy` returns, so this reads the deployment until it agrees or
 * `--settle-ms` (default 90 s, $CANARY_SETTLE_MS) passes, rather than judging
 * on the first read. A match on the first read costs one round trip and no
 * wait. A disagreement that outlives the window fails exactly as it always
 * did, and the failure says how long it waited and what it saw. Pass
 * `--settle-ms 0` for the old single-read behaviour. BuildPropagation.ts
 * carries the reasoning and the loop.
 *
 * The HTML-vs-asset row compares the served app document (the prerendered
 * /<owner>/<name>/ page, the one HTML in the build that carries the stamp) with
 * the served /__build.json and fails either direction of disagreement,
 * including HTML that carries no stamp at all. It does not fetch the hashed
 * chunks the document names. Pass --allow-unstamped-html only while the deploy that introduces the
 * stamp is landing; it downgrades that row to a skip and never to a pass.
 *
 * This file is the process shell only. Every verdict lives in BuildStamp.ts
 * and the waiting in BuildPropagation.ts, both unit-tested; the real fetch,
 * the real clock and the exit code are the untested lines.
