/*
 * The canary uptime probe (CN-19, CN-20, CN-21).
 *
 *   bun scripts/canary/uptime-probe.ts [origin] [options]
 *
 *     --json <path>       write the machine-readable report (uptime-report.ts reads it)
 *     --samples <n>       samples per unmetered endpoint (default 5)
 *     --gap-ms <n>        milliseconds between samples (default 250)
 *     --timeout-ms <n>    per-request ceiling (default 20000)
 *     --no-turn           never take the metered turn, even with a cookie set
 *
 *   $CANARY_URL             the origin, when no POSITIONAL origin is given.
 *                           The origin is argv[0] and nothing else, so a
 *                           flag's value can never become the target.
 *   $CANARY_SESSION_COOKIE  a signed-in cookie header for the SCOPED-DOWN test
 *                           account. Present: the run reads the session back,
 *                           and only if that account is a plain visitor does it
 *                           take ONE metered turn and measure CN-19's real bar.
 *                           Absent: the run measures the signed-out refusal
 *                           gate and says so, and never claims otherwise.
 *   $CANARY_SESSION_LOGIN   the login that cookie must belong to. Falls back to
 *                           $SMITHERS_E2E_USER, the same scoped account the
 *                           browser sign-in probe uses
 *                           (apps/app/e2e/probes/signin-roundtrip.mjs). Unset,
 *                           and with a deployment that states no `admin` field,
 *                           the identity check fails rather than guess.
 *   $CANARY_ALLOWLIST_LOGINS the hand-seeded closed-alpha roster, the same
 *                           repository variable invite-probe.ts reads. A cookie
 *                           belonging to one of those logins fails the run.
 *
 * WHOSE ACCOUNT. Will's ruling (Factory spec 2026-09-08, RULINGS 35): the
 * canary and e2e suites run as a scoped-down signed-in user, never an admin and
 * never an allowlisted one, so a permission bug that refuses ordinary visitors
 * cannot hide behind the operator's own privileges. A probe that needs admin
 * says so with its own credential and skips out loud without it — invite-probe.ts
 * and $IDENTITY_ADMIN_TOKEN are the one example. The accounts and variables are
 * documented in apps/server/DEPLOY.md.
 *
 * WHAT THIS RUN COSTS. Without the cookie: nothing. Every request is a static
 * asset read, an unauthenticated scopes read, or a refusal that never reaches
 * an upstream. With the cookie: exactly one short model turn — a nine-word
 * prompt, a two-word instruction, and the stream cancelled at the first frame.
 * The scheduled workflow supplies the cookie on the hourly tick only, so the
 * standing cost is 24 short turns a day.
 *
 * This file is the process shell only: argument parsing, the real fetch,
 * printing and the exit code. Every decision it prints comes from
 * uptime-checks.ts, which is covered by uptime-checks.test.ts. The fetch is
 * the one line in this lane that no test can reach.
