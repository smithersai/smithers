 * untested line in this lane is the network call itself: `uptime-probe.ts`
 * supplies a real `fetch`, `runUptimeProbe` takes it as a dependency, and the
 * tests beside this file supply a fake. That split exists because the lane has
 * no credential and no live deployment, so a probe whose decision logic could
 * only be exercised against production would never have been demonstrated at
 * all.
 *
 * Three separate questions, deliberately not collapsed into one number:
 *
 *   CN-21 uptime      — did each endpoint answer at all?
 *   CN-20 error rate  — of the requests we made, what fraction failed?
 *   CN-19 latency     — how long did the ones that answered take?
 *
 * An endpoint that is down fails all three. An endpoint that is up but flaky
 * fails only the error rate. An endpoint that is up and reliable but slow fails
 * only latency. Collapsing them would lose which of the three is true.

 *
 *   turnFirstFrame 30_000 — one third of the bar, leaving 60s for every other
 *     segment, which the segments below show is ample. It is deliberately
 *     twice the 15s a median-backed budget would use, because this endpoint is

 *     median to absorb a Cloudflare Worker cold start, so the budget absorbs
 *     it instead. At 30s a single sample is a broken turn seam, not a cold one.
 *   spa 2_000 — the SPA is static assets from Cloudflare's edge. This is a
 *     transfer, not a computation.
 *   scopes 1_500 and turnGate 1_500 — both refuse or answer without reaching
 *     an upstream. `/api/agent/turn` signed out is rejected by
 *     requireTurnSession before the rate limiter and before any model call
 *     (apps/server/src/index.ts), so this measures the gate, not a turn.
 *
