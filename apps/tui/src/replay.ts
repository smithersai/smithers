/**
 * A seat that replays a recorded run's model stream instead of calling a
 * provider.
 *
 * `SMITHERS_TUI_REPLAY=run.jsonl` (recorded with `SMITHERS_TUI_RECORD`) makes
 * the n-th model call stream the n-th recorded reply at its recorded pace.
 * The cells it carries run for real against the working directory, so a
 * replay reproduces a whole turn offline: demos, bug reports, and the
 * terminal end-to-end suite. `SMITHERS_TUI_REPLAY_HOLD_MS` holds every reply
 * before its first delta, which keeps a turn running long enough to stop it;
 * `SMITHERS_TUI_REPLAY_SPEED` divides every recorded delay.
