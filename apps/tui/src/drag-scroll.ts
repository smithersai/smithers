/**
 * Keeps a selection drag scrolling its scroll box after the pointer leaves it.
 *
 * opentui autoscrolls a `<scrollbox>` only from drag events it receives, and
 * the renderer sends each drag to the renderable under the pointer. Dragging
 * a transcript selection onto the tab row above or the composer below hits a
 * renderable outside the scroll box, so it never scrolled. Mounted on the root
 * box, these handlers see every bubbled drag and forward it to the scroll box
 * the press started in.
