# Smithers MVP engineering rules

## Keyboard-only access is a product rule (Will, 2026-09-08)

Users must be able to operate all of Smithers without a mouse. Every action needs an accessible keyboard path, visible focus, and predictable focus movement. Use native control semantics, Tab/Shift-Tab navigation, Enter/Space activation, Escape dismissal, and appropriate arrow-key navigation. Preserve normal text editing. No hover-only, drag-only, or pointer-only required action. Keyboard-only completion is a release check for every new workflow, including onboarding.

## Current onboarding brief (Will, 2026-09-08)

The new shell opens with a one-second SMITHERS entrance and progressively introduces capabilities. The UI is the default view: full-screen, no composer. Command-K summons ONLY the composer — a solid bottom dock that animates open and pushes the content up; the chat history lives in the workspace above. Escape or a second Command-K closes the dock with the reverse animation. This explicit brief supersedes the always-visible-chat and fixed-sidebar requirements below. Outputs still use the existing flows and shared state; the guide is documented in `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.


## ⚖️ THE EMBED LAW — read this before anything else (will, 2026-08-09, permanent)

**Everything embeds in the chat. Nothing opens full-screen unless the user explicitly asks.**

This binds BOTH agent populations:

1. **Agents building this app:** every capability's output renders as a card/embed inside the transcript at conversation width, composer visible below. Building a surface that opens as a takeover/full-screen/second view by default is a defect — the diff gets rejected. Full-screen exists only as a _presentation transition of the same embedded component_ (maximize), entered only by the user's explicit act.
2. **The agent inside the app (encode this in its system prompt and tool projection):** when the user asks about something ("what is in the wiki?"), the agent ANSWERS IN THE CHAT — with an embedded card when a surface is involved — and never opens a full-screen view. Surface-maximizing commands are user-triggered only (`trigger: user` on the axis); the agent's invocation of any surface command renders its embedded form. Full-screen happens only when the user explicitly asks for it, in those words.

The user has stated this law repeatedly; violations keep shipping. Treat any full-screen-by-default behavior — new or existing — as a bug to fix on sight, not legacy to preserve.

## ⚖️ NO INVENTION (will, 2026-08-09, permanent)

Nothing user-visible may be added unless the current brief or the canon (`DESIGN.md`, the vault laws) names it: no decorative chrome, no status badges, no extra pills, no helpful-seeming labels or placeholder copy. Absence is the default; an empty state is a valid state. Unrequested user-visible additions are defects, not initiative.

## ⚖️ THE THREE-DOOR LAW (will, 2026-09-03, permanent)

**Anything a button does, the agent can do.** Every act is ONE flow with three doors: slash, button, and agent. `userOnly` is an enumerated exception for acts that are physically the human's gesture (a folder dialog, an OAuth redirect, focus, a menu, a slider, the clipboard) or that the human alone may answer (a confirm dialog, a picker card, an approval), and every such flow names its reason in the registry as `userOnlyReason` — `flows/agent-parity.test.ts` enumerates every one and fails on a user-only flow without a reason. Consequential acts (launching Claude Code or another harness, running a target, closing a session, unpinning a repository) are agent-invocable WITH `confirm`: the agent's invocation renders the confirm card and the human's click runs the flow. They are never user-only because they are consequential. When a user-only act has an agent door (`auth.prompt`, `cloud.prompt`, `app.download.prompt` render the human's button in the chat), the refusal names it. Opening a local terminal or launching a harness is the product's main act, not browser mechanics. The button door is typed on both sides: a card names its flow as a `FlowName` (`flows/FlowName.ts`, so a misspelling does not compile) and hands its values to `flowArgs` (`flows/FlowArgs.ts`), which writes the one slash line the flow's grammar parses. A card never interpolates a line of its own; only the slash door passes text a human typed.

## ⚖️ THE FORM LAW (will, 2026-09-03, permanent)

**A flow invoked without its required input, by the agent or by a slash, renders a form card for exactly the missing fields, prefilled with whatever was given. No door ever answers with a usage sentence.** The form is derived from the flow's own input schema (`flows/FlowForms.ts`) plus the flow's `form` hints; its options come only from the seams (installed harnesses with credential state, model lists, open repos, cloud repos, loaded bookmarks, workspaces, agents); its draft lives in the card payload and commits through `form.set`; Submit (`form.submit`) runs the same flow as the actor that asked, so a consequential flow the agent asked for still confirms. The agent's tool result says "rendered a form for <fields>" so the model tells the human to fill it in, never to type arguments. A button always carries its args and never meets the form.

- Do not use React `useEffect` in application code.
- Prefer derived values during render, event-driven updates, TanStack Query for server state, and focused hooks from a maintained hooks library for external subscriptions.
- If synchronization truly cannot fit one of those patterns, stop and document why before introducing lifecycle synchronization.
- React components are projections, never authorities for application state. Store all application state in TanStack DB collections.
- `useState` is exempt only for transient chrome that no reader would miss after a reload: a "Copied" flag on its timer, a menu's keyboard highlight, an open/closed disclosure with no address. Anything a card projects — a filter, a selection, a drawer, a view mode — lives in the card payload and changes through a flow, so it survives a reload and an open-in-tab (`cards/TargetCards.tsx` `target.filter` / `target.select`, `cards/GraphCard.tsx` `target.graph.filter` / `target.graph.focus`).
- Human, Smithers, and system changes must enter through the shared Flux transition dispatcher with their actor recorded.
- Persist local collections with SQLite. Preserve the collection boundary so Electric can become the synced authority without rewriting UI consumers.
- Keep Smithers' Wiki (its world state; the `world` ids persist under the Wiki label) as Markdown-native, linked documents in its own TanStack DB collection. Record provenance, confidence, actor, and revision; do not present inferred world state as ground truth.
- Build every agent context from a fresh versioned world-state snapshot. React does not assemble or own agent context.

## Frames are the navigation model

- New capability output appears first as a chat message containing an embedded mini-app. No capability opens a tab or replaces chat by default.
- Embedded and maximized views render the same frame component from the same persisted state. Maximizing is a presentation transition, not a second implementation.
- A maximized frame keeps Smithers chrome visible: the composer overlays or remains adjacent to the content, and minimize, back, and forward remain available.
- Every visible frame has a durable identity, parent frame, workspace, branch, and app-state revision. Persist the frame graph in SQLite through the shared transition dispatcher and journal.
- Put stable frame, workspace, and branch identifiers in the URL. The URL is a pointer into durable state, not the state payload.
  Exception (will, 2026-09-07): the app for a repository lives at exactly /owner/name; when the page boots from that path the address bar keeps it for the page's life and the frame location travels in history.state (runtime/FrameHistory.ts).
- Browser back and forward traverse frame history. Forking any historical frame creates a new workspace branch rooted at that frame's recorded revision without mutating the original branch.
- Frame navigation, maximize, minimize, back, forward, and fork are Flows with the same slash, agent, and button invocation path as every other capability.
- Deep-link reload, back/forward, historical fork, unchanged embedded/maximized component identity, and composer visibility are mandatory end-to-end tests.

## New Smithers only

- Product code under `src/` uses the new Flows, Harness, Journal, Kernel, and related `@smthrs/*` implementations owned by this repository's `packages/` tree.
- Do not import retired runtime packages into the product.
- The `smithersai/ui` repository is interaction reference code, not a dependency authority; its remaining `@smthrs/*` imports do not authorize those imports here.
- Enforce this boundary with dependency and forbidden-import tests so a legacy package cannot return transitively unnoticed.
- Smithers workflow dashboards under `.smithers/ui/` are control-plane tooling, not shipped product code, and may use the workflow runtime's own Gateway UI components.

## Smithers workflows

Use your best judgment, weighing speed, quality, and token usage, to decide
whether a request should run as a [smithers.sh](https://smithers.sh) workflow
or with regular subagents. Prefer a smithers workflow for multi-step plans and
for work that benefits from retries, approvals, review, or replay; reach for
plain subagents when a request is a quick one-off.

The `smithers` skill is installed: run `smithers workflow list` to see the
available workflows and `smithers workflow run <id>` to launch one.

When a session ends successfully and the work could have been a smithers
workflow, offer to turn the session into a reusable smithers workflow for next
time.
