/*
 * The plugin seam: the ONE way this app is customized.
 *
 * The model is TypeScript's own language-service plugin, restated in Effect.
 * A `tsserver` plugin is handed the language service every plugin before it
 * left behind and returns the service the next plugin will see; load order is
 * therefore meaningful, a plugin can read (and wrap) what an earlier plugin
 * contributed, and nothing can reach past the object it was given. Here the
 * decorated thing is the app itself — `AppSurface`, the record of everything
 * a plugin may add to the workspace — and activation is an `Effect`, so a
 * plugin can fail with a typed reason and can ask the host for services
 * through the environment instead of importing the app.
 *
 * What a plugin may add is deliberately narrow. Every rail entry names a
 * REGISTERED flow (the three-doors law: a button is a flow, a slash command
 * is that same flow, the agent's door is that same flow), so a plugin cannot
 * invent an affordance the registry has never heard of. The gallery's copy is
 * catalog metadata on the manifest; the behaviour is flows that already exist.
