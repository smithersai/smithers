/*
 * The first-party plugin catalog: the shelf `/plugins` browses.
 *
 * A catalog entry is an `AppPlugin` — the manifest a person reads plus the
 * activation that decorates the app. Every flow named here is a flow this app
 * already registers (catalog.test.ts pins that against the registry), so
 * installing a plugin never promises an affordance the runtime cannot honour:
 * it collects flows that already exist into a named, installable capability
 * and puts its entries on the workspace rail.
 *
 * Order is the shelf order: `recommended` states the rank the gallery leads
 * with. It is a stated recommendation, never a popularity number this app has
 * no way to measure.
