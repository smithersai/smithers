/*
 * Wave 13c — the truth bar has no tail.
 *
 * After wave 13 the five §F impossible asks answered honestly in ~7 of 8 live
 * runs; the observed tail (F-5) laundered the impossible act through a
 * workflow OFFER on a plain answer turn, where the launch-turn gate never
 * looks. The backstop now extends to the response-to-an-action-ask case: the
 * ask's class is detected from the user's own words (impossibleAskOf), and an
 * answer that offers the act — directly or through a workflow — renders the
 * class's deterministic honest line (Instructions.ts ASK_HONEST_LINES)
 * instead. Keyed on the ask, so ordinary conversation never enters the gate.
