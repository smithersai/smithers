/*
 * The node drawer's reader state: which node of a graph a card has open, and
 * which of that node's tabs.
 *
 * A graph card draws a node per plan node; opening one is a drill-in, and a
 * drill-in is a fact about the card, not component state. The four flows here
 * write it, so a reload restores the drawer a person left open, the agent
 * reaches the same act, and nothing in the canvas owns a `useState` it would
 * lose on the next poll.
 *
 * Every select is validated against the nodes the card actually carries: the
 * plan's own for a plan card, and the plan's plus the JOURNAL's for a run,
 * because a run draws the graph the engine recorded and that graph can carry
 * nodes a plan snapshot never had (FlowGraphStatus.ts). An id neither answers
 * to is refused by name rather than opening a drawer over nothing.
