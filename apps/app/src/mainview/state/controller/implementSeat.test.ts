/*
 * The implement seat, pinned (factory-spec review RULINGS 42, Will,
 * 2026-09-08): "Implement runs on the SMART seat always, first try included.
 * The fast seat is not the implementer. Cost control is parallelism, caching,
 * and prototype-first, never a cheaper model for the implementation itself."
 *
 * No code here picks a seat tier for a run, and this file is not where that
 * starts. Seats are declared, never inferred: a flow names its own model in
 * its `model:` frontmatter or in `AgentAction`'s `seat` option, a markdown
 * flow that names none asks for `smart`
 * (packages/smithers/flows/core/src/Markdown.ts), and the host's
 * `SeatResolver` turns that declared string into a live model.
 *
 * One thing in this app still names a model, so it is the one that could
 * quietly cheapen an implement run: the built-in role table
 * (packages/rpc/src/AgentRoles.ts), where each role binds one model. It is
 * pinned here, so a change to a cheaper implementer fails a test rather than
 * shipping. `agent.delegate` used to be pinned beside it; that flow launched
 * a harness session on this machine and retired with the local backend
 * (apps/app/docs/LOCAL-BACKEND-RETIREMENT.md).
