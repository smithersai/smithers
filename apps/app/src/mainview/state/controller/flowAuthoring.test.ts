/*
 * The authoring canvas grows while the author works.
 *
 * Will asked for "an agent walking you through building a flow in real time".
 * The controller observed the journal only once the authoring run reached a
 * terminal status, so a `create-flow` that wrote the flow in its first minute
 * and kept working for another ten showed nothing until it ended. What a
 * reader can be shown is decided by the journal, not by the summary: a
 * `copy-back-settled` row naming `flows/<id>/flow.*` is a source that exists
 * on the workspace, and it is planned as soon as it lands.
 *
 * The run below NEVER settles — its summary answers `running` for as long as
 * the test asks — so a plan of the authored flow can only be a mid-run plan.
