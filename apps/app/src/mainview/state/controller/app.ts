/*
 * The app itself as a flow target (docs/web-mode/PLAN.md §3): the web app's
 * one door to the native app.
 *
 * `app.download` opens the download URL through whatever shell the page has —
 * the native shell's openExternal door when present, otherwise a new browser
 * tab. `app.download.prompt` renders the refusal card whose action IS that
 * flow, mirroring auth.prompt / auth.sign-in: `window.open` outside a user
 * gesture is popup-blocked, so the card is the prompt and the click is the
 * human's. Commands.ts renders the same card for every native-only miss, so a
 * typed slash, a button and the agent's tool call all answer alike.
 *
 * The door exists only when there is something behind it: until a native
 * release carries an asset (AppLinks.ts, null today) no button is rendered
 * anywhere and the card says so in words.
