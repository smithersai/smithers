/*
 * Canary W1 item 3a, second half. A consequential door whose refusal has to
 * outlive a four-second toast appends the sentence to the transcript itself
 * and returns it; the form card must not print the same sentence underneath.
 * Which transcript line that is cannot be "the last one": between the door's
 * `message.appended` and the form's patch any other actor may append — and
 * then the tail comparison the first fix used goes false and the duplicate is
 * back. The door marks its own line (`Message.spoken`) and the form reads the
 * mark, within this submission only.
 *
 * And it reads the mark by CLAIMING it (controller/spokenLines.ts). A door's
 * line stands in for at most one act, so a row that merely matched the
 * sentence yielded to a line another act had already been given: two lost
 * acts, one line, with the second act's word going to a form card that then
 * printed nothing. The last test here is that shape.
