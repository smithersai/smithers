/*
 * Control focus ("spotlight"): whenever the human is driving one surface —
 * a terminal, a box's desktop, a browser card, a markdown editor — the rest
 * of the app dims and blurs a touch, modal-style, and the surface wears an
 * outset ring. Clicking out releases, exactly like a modal backdrop, and the
 * releasing click never activates what it landed on.
 *
 * The state is one app-level record owned by the controller, never React
 * state and never a journal transition: it is a projection of where focus
 * physically is, changing with every focus event, so persisting it would
 * spam the journal. Components read it through `useSyncExternalStore`;
 * every surface is detected declaratively from the DOM, so this module is
 * the only authority:
 *
 *  - terminal / desktop / browser surfaces mark their interactive element
 *    with `data-control-focus-id` + `data-control-focus-kind`;
 *  - the markdown editor adapter forwards no attributes, so it is detected
 *    by its own `data-slot="markdown-editor"` root;
 *  - a cross-origin iframe takes focus without any :focus-visible signal
 *    the parent can see (CSS :focus-within and :has(iframe:focus) are all
 *    false for it), so frames are detected the probe-verified way: window
 *    blur + document.activeElement === the iframe.
 *
 * Every marker this module writes is namespaced `data-control-focus*`. The
 * bare `data-controlled` belongs to the onboarding shell, which renders it on
 * every guide bubble (`data-controlled={step === stage}`, stringified by React
 * so even "false" matches a bare attribute selector); sharing the name lifted
 * every bubble above the pinned navigation.
