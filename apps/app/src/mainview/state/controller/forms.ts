 * `flow-form` card: its fields derive from the flow's input schema
 * (flows/FlowForms.ts), its options come from the seams named below and
 * nowhere else (NO INVENTION), and its draft IS the card payload — every
 * field commit is `form.set`, a card-payload update through the dispatcher,
 * never component state. `form.submit` assembles the one slash line the
 * flow's grammar parses and re-enters the run path AS THE ACTOR THAT ASKED:
 * a form the agent rendered submits as the agent, so a consequential flow
 * still confirms and the human's click stays the act (THE THREE-DOOR LAW).
