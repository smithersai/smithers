   * upserts carries the kind, so the run renders as a trace with the

   * No `prototype` flow ships yet, so the honest answer today is a refusal
   * naming the flow the workspace lacks, never a fake run. The workspace is
   * the only authority on which flows it has (`.smithers/factory.json` lists
   * rules, not flows, and the flow list is a gateway read), so the check
   * comes after provisioning and before anything is planned or approved: the
   * flow.list seam answers first, and a launch the workspace still refuses
   * with ControlError.FlowNotFound (which carries no message) is read off
   * that error's code, never off its prose.
