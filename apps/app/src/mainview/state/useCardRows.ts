/*
 * The transcript's cards, read live from the store.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than a bare `useLiveQuery(collections.cards)`: the
 * hook's row type is INFERRED from the collection, and TanStack DB's
 * inference gives up once the `Card` union passes thirty members — TResult
 * falls back to its `object` constraint, so `data` types as `{}[]` and every
 * `card.id` / `<CardView card={card}>` downstream stops compiling. Measured
 * on this tree: 29 members infer, 30 do not; the five target-graph cards
 * (graph, run-timeline, run-history, affected, ci-matrix) took it over.
 *
 * Naming the type arguments skips that inference entirely. The collection's
 * own row type is the truth — `createCardCollection` keys `Card` records with
 * `CardSchema` — so this states it in ONE place instead of at every reader.
