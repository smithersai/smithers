/*
 * The canary's own census, verbatim (.artifacts/mvp-canary-walk-20260917/
 * W1-a-buttons-and-chat.json, W1-g-discard-and-retry.json), and the host
 * answers behind it (W1-00-state-issues.json, W1-00-state-feature.json):
 *
 *   23:22:41.531  state-issues   registrationActive {enabled:false, revision:4}   registrationState "known"
 *   23:22:42.113  state-feature  registrationActive {enabled:true,  revision:57}  registrationState "known"
 *   23:22:59.523  cardsAfterClear []
 *   23:22:59.522  L83-freshConversationJobButtons  "Handle issues" … "Build a feature"   (every label plain)
 *   23:24:34      cardsAfterOpen  ['issues']
 *   23:42:25.546  jobButtonsWithState  "Handle issues · Paused" … "Build a feature"
 *   23:42:52.300  featureCard     ['feature']   ← the feature card's first appearance
 *
 * Every registration the walk read was "known"; no receipt in it carries
 * "unknown" or "unavailable". What moved between the two button censuses was
 * the CARD: with none open no button read a state, and with the issues card
 * open only that button did. `repositoryJobStates` reads cards and nothing
 * else, because a registration reaches this app only through a setup card's
 * own recovery (controller/repositorySetup.ts `recover()`, GET
 * /api/repository-setup/state?repo&job, asked per job for a card that already
 * exists). Both tests below are that census, held in place.
