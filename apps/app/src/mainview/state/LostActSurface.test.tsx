/*
 * The other half of a lost act: the act that reached nothing because THIS APP
 * threw, not because the browser refused a write.
 *
 * A form field is the busiest door in the app — every flow form, including the
 * repository setup card's own question, commits each keystroke through
 * `form.set` — and the staging step that runs before its write is ordinary
 * code that can have an ordinary bug. When it threw, the throw left the
 * command through a `.then` with no `.catch`: the field snapped back to the
 * value it already had, no toast, no transcript line, and an unhandled
 * rejection in the console the person will never see. That is the same silence
 * a refused write used to have, reached by a different road.
 *
 * A bug is not a storage fault and must not borrow its words: "make it again;
 * if it fails twice, reload the page" is retry advice for something that will
 * never succeed. It gets its own arm, its own fault class, and a sentence that
 * says whose bug it is.
