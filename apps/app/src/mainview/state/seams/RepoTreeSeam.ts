/*
 * The sidebar's file tree seam (docs/workbench-lanes/sidebar-tree.md): one
 * directory of a working copy, written to the `app-repo-tree` row for that
 * directory. A LOCAL checkout reads through the same route the files flows
 * use (`POST /api/repo/files { repoId, path }`, FilesSeam's
 * requestLocalFiles). A cloud WORKSPACE copy (a box) reads through the route
 * its Files facet uses (`GET /api/repos/{o}/{r}/workspaces/{id}/files?path=`,
 * WorkspaceSeam.loadFiles). The SHARED copy of a public repository (the
 * read-only virtual box every reader shares, lane plan B2) reads
 * through the public contents route the files flows read
 * (`GET /api/repos/{o}/{r}/contents[/path]`, forwarded to the Smithers Cloud
 * mirror with no credentials: apps/server publicRepositoryReads.ts). The row
 * is what the sidebar renders: `loaded` with exactly the entries the route
 * returned (no filtering, nothing invented), or `failed` with the route's
 * error text verbatim, shown in place. Every row holds its directory in the
 * one order a listing reads in (`FilesSeam.sortEntries`: directories first,
 * then by name), because the three routes do not agree on one — the mirror
 * answers a git tree's byte order — and the sidebar reads the same for a
 * checkout, a box, and the shared copy. A path that leaves the repository
 * is refused before any route is asked (FilesSeam.unsafePath), because
 * the encodings these three URLs use leave `..` alone. Never throws.
