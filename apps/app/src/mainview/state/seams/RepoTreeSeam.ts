/*
 * The sidebar's file tree seam (docs/workbench-lanes/sidebar-tree.md): one
 * directory of a working copy, written to the `app-repo-tree` row for that
 * directory. A cloud WORKSPACE copy (a box) reads through the route its
 * Files facet uses (`GET /api/repos/{o}/{r}/workspaces/{id}/files?path=`,
 * WorkspaceSeam.loadFiles). The SHARED copy of a public repository (the
 * read-only virtual box every reader shares, lane plan B2) reads
 * through the public contents route the files flows read
 * (`GET /api/repos/{o}/{r}/contents[/path]`, forwarded to the Smithers Cloud
 * mirror with no credentials: apps/server publicRepositoryReads.ts). Those
 * are the only two routes: the app offers the web app's feature set, so a
 * copy that is neither is refused in place (apps/app/docs/
 * LOCAL-BACKEND-RETIREMENT.md). The row is what the sidebar renders:
 * `loaded` with exactly the entries the route returned (no filtering,
 * nothing invented), or `failed` with the route's error text verbatim, shown
 * in place. Every row holds its directory in the one order a listing reads
 * in (`FilesSeam.sortEntries`: directories first, then by name), because the
 * two routes do not agree on one — the mirror answers a git tree's byte
 * order — and the sidebar reads the same for a box and the shared copy. A
 * path that leaves the repository is refused before any route is asked
 * (FilesSeam.unsafePath), because the encodings these URLs use leave `..`
 * alone. Never throws.
