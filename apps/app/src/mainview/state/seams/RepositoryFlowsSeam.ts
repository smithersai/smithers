/*
 * The repository-flows seam: the flow catalog of the active repository, as
 * `.smithers/factory.json` declares it (the `flows` rows of the factory
 * projection), held in the `repositoryFlows` collection so the registry can
 * derive one slash leaf per row synchronously (flows/entries/flow.ts
 * `repositoryFlowLeaves`). Homepage flow buttons and slash leaves read these
 * same rows.
 *
 * The read is the public contents route the Dispatcher card and the palette's
 * target search already use (TriggersSeam.readFactoryProjection), allowlisted
 * signed out, so a visitor sees the repository's flows before signing in. The
 * leaves themselves defer through sign-in when run: that door is flow.run's.
 *
 * Data-driven end to end: the collection holds what the mirror answered and
 * nothing else. A mirror without a projection has no leaves; the row also
 * carries its resolved homepage or a visible read failure. A repository that
 * stops being the target keeps its row, and the leaves follow the target (AppController
 * `repositoryFlows`). Each repository is read once per session, in the
 * background, the first time it becomes the target; `load` re-reads on demand.
 * No flow name is written in this app.
 *
 * The target is re-resolved after every transition rather than after a
 * hand-kept list of them: the native app makes a checkout the target through
 * `repos.loaded` (ControllerBoot at boot, targets.ts after repo.open), the
 * cloud host through `repositories.loaded` and `repo.selected`, and a list
 * that named some of these once missed the local host entirely (review
 * finding on 9ab275caf5). Resolving is a few collection reads and the
 * per-repository dedup makes a repeat resolution free.
