/*
 * WHAT THIS FILE MEASURES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
 *
 * Twice running this lane stated a safety property about EVERY door and
 * measured it at one. "A lost act is never silent" held until a reviewer drove
 * two refused presses at one door. "The failure mode is one duplicate line,
 * never silence" held until a reviewer drove two lost acts at two doors inside
 * one window. Both sentences were true where they were measured and false one
 * door over, and the report said the class was closed both times.
 *
 * So this file runs both halves of the lost-act path under every door in the
 * inventory (scripts/durable-write-doors.ts), read at run time so a door
 * declared tomorrow is driven tomorrow and a door that cannot be driven is
 * NAMED in a failure rather than skipped in silence. Read it as a ROLL CALL:
 * it is coverage, and R104e measured exactly how much each layer is worth.
 *
 *   1. REACHED. Every door is run through the seam every door shares: this
 *      browser refuses the commit that records the command itself
 *      (controller/commandIntents.ts), so the act reaches nothing for a reason
 *      that is not the person's, at a door that needs no card on screen.
 *      WHAT IT MEASURES: that the flow id is registered here and its intent
 *      write can be refused. That commit happens before any handler runs, so
 *      nothing about the handler — and nothing about the property that put a
 *      flow in the inventory, "its handler can reach a durable write" — is
 *      exercised. R104e ran this same loop over the 201 declared flows the
 *      inventory EXCLUDES: 194 of them behave identically, and the other 7 are
 *      simply not registered in this controller. So this layer does NOT
 *      distinguish the inventory's 78 from the flows it leaves out.
 *
 *   2. COUNTED. Every door's name is then driven through
 *      `surfaceCommandFailure` — the one place that decides whether a lost act
 *      gets a line — in the overlap the reviewer drove: two acts admitted
 *      before either settles, one door speaking its own sentence inside both
 *      windows.
 *      WHAT IT MEASURES: one rule, once, under 78 labels. Inside
 *      controller/failures.ts the door's name reaches only the toast key and
 *      `ctx.commands.find(name)`, which the fixture below stubs to `undefined`;
 *      the transcript-line decision never reads it. R104e drove the same
 *      overlap with `""`, `"not.a.flow"`, `"☃"` and a 500-character name and
 *      got two lines every time. So the loop bound is NOT evidence that the
 *      overlap clause holds at 78 doors, and must not be quoted as such.
 *
 * WHERE THE OVERLAP CLAUSE IS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED: in the seam, by
 * controller/spokenLines.test.ts — a door's line is spent when an act takes
 * it, so it stands in for at most one act — and end to end at TWO real doors
 * (`setup.configure`, `runs.open`) through the real card and a real refused
 * write, in RepositorySetupRunMode.test.tsx. Two, not seventy-eight.
 */
/*
 * Every feature flag on, because the inventory reads SOURCE and the roll call
 * reads a controller. A door declared behind a flag is in the inventory either
 * way, so a controller that leaves its flag off cannot register it, and the
 * roll call names it "not registered in this controller" — a hole in the claim
 * rather than a door that fails.
