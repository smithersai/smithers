 * A controller door that REFUSES an edit already owns its sentence. This file

 * browser's saved data then FAILED. That half had no vocabulary at all, so it
 * reached the person as a rejected promise — one generic toast, gone after
 * four seconds, while the control that fired it snapped back to the value it
 * already had and the transcript said nothing. The person could not tell a
 * refusal from a lost write, and the only two strings available to describe
 * one were an internal flow id and a storage boundary key.
 *
 * The set is closed and every arm carries its own sentence, so a new way for a
 * write to fail cannot inherit a line that is merely vague, and cannot ship
 * with no line at all: `satisfies Record<BrowserWriteFault, …>` is a compile
 * error until somebody writes the words a person can act on.
