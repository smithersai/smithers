/*
 * The client half of the crash sink. A page that throws posts one report to
 * POST /api/telemetry/errors, the one route every target serves:
 *   - the Go backend (the desktop app's default target, reached through the
 *     relay) and Plue log it and count it in smithers_client_errors_total;
 *   - the Worker in front of the web build keeps it in a bounded Durable Object
 *     for GET /api/admin/errors and exports the count to Plue.
 * Without this the first anyone hears of a broken flow is a user mentioning it.
 *
 * The body is the Go backend's ClientErrorReport (internal/routes/telemetry.go)
 * plus `kind` and `at`, which Go ignores and the Worker's log keeps. The
 * contract is testable here, so a rename on either side turns a test red
 * instead of quietly pointing every crash report at a 404. There is no second
 * copy of the reporter to drift from it.
 *
 * Bounds, each for a reason:
 *   - the path is a constant, not a literal at the call site, so the client
 *     and the routes cannot drift apart unnoticed;
 *   - each error field is cut to the Go backend's own cap, in UTF-8 bytes, so
 *     Go's byte-index truncation never splits a character;
 *   - the posted body is cut to CLIENT_ERROR_BODY_MAX_BYTES, so escaping
 *     cannot push a report past the Worker route's cap and be answered 413;
 *   - a page reports at most CLIENT_ERROR_REPORT_LIMIT times, so an error in
 *     a render loop cannot turn one broken tab into a request storm.
 *
 * Reporting is fire-and-forget in both directions: it never throws, never
 * awaits, and never surfaces its own failure. A page that just crashed is not
 * helped by the report crashing too.
