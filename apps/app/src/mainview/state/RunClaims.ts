 * Wave 12 §1 — result claims are DETERMINISTIC.
 *
 * Wave 10 §2a taught that a deterministic affordance must not route through the
 * model. Wave 11 proved the same holds for result CLAIMS: with a run card beside
 * it truthfully reading *Running*, the deployed model wrote
 *
 *   The workflow "summarize-open-issues" has been created and is now running
 *
 * — an invented name and a creation that had not happened. The tool result was
 * unmistakable, the system prompt said not to, and it rounded up anyway. Prompt
 * discipline is not a mechanism.
 *
 * So the claim surface stops being the model's. After a run-launch tool call the
 * client renders the model's prose for that turn ONLY if it makes no claim about
 * run state; otherwise the deterministic line below is substituted. Blunt on
 * purpose: a suppressed hallucination is invisible, a shipped one is a truth-bar
 * failure. Nothing here touches the store or the DOM, so the rule is unit-pinned.

 * Wave 13 §F — capability theater, caught where detection is honest.
 *
 * The generated capability section (Instructions.ts) is the primary lever; this
 * is the backstop for the one turn shape where a deterministic detector can
 * tell an offer from a conversation: a LAUNCH turn, where the model just asked
 * the app to do something and its prose rides beside a real run card. The live
 * F-1 failure was exactly this shape — "I can set up a Smithers workflow that
 * drafts and emails a summary …" — an offer of an effect no connector has,
 * laundered through a workflow.
 *
 * The detector fires only when an OFFER construction and a NAMED impossible
 * effect co-occur; general conversation about email or Slack in a turn that
 * launched nothing never passes through here (renderedRunTurnText runs only
 * for launch turns), so this censors nothing the wave-12 gate didn't already
 * own.
 *
 * Two things are load-bearing, and the launch-morning transcript proves both.
 *
 * The apostrophe: the deployed model writes the TYPOGRAPHIC one — every §F
 * answer says "can’t" (U+2019), not "can't" — and that same blindness cost the
 * checklist harness two false failures this morning. Matching only the ASCII
 * form inverts the rule: "I can’t post to Slack yet" reads as "I can" beside
 * "Slack", so the ONE honest answer §F asks for would be the answer this gate
 * discards. Prose is normalized before either pattern sees it.
 *
 * The offer anchor: every offer phrase is SPEAKER-SCOPED ("I" or "we"). A
 * bare "set up" also appears in the honest refusal itself ("…because no
 * Slack connector is set up"), so an unanchored verb reads a refusal as an
 * offer. What survives is only a model speaking about what IT will do —
 * which still catches the laundered form ("I can't do it directly, but I'll
 * set up a workflow that emails your team"), because a workflow calls the
 * same catalog. The "we" forms joined in wave 13c: the live §F-4/§F-5
 * laundering spoke as "we can set up a workflow that…", and a plural offer
 * launders exactly like a singular one.

 * Wave 13c — the truth bar has no tail: the response to an ACTION ask.
 *
 * Wave 13 armed the offer detector only on launch turns, the one shape where
 * a claim rides beside a real run card. The one live miss after that (§F-5,
 * observed once in eight runs) laundered the impossible act on a PLAIN answer
 * turn — no tool call at all, just "we can create a Smithers workflow that
 * creates the PR and then returns the link — once you approve the run, the PR
 * will be opened". Prompt discipline alone leaves that tail open.
 *
 * Detection here is honest because it keys on the ASK, not the answer: the
 * five §F classes (email, local files, unconnected messaging tools, direct
 * push, PR-with-link) are readable from the user's own words, so ONLY a turn
 * whose ask names an impossible class is held and reviewed. Conversation
 * ABOUT email, and asks for things the catalog can do, never enter here —
 * this is not a general censor. When the answer to such an ask offers the act
 * (directly or through a workflow) instead of the honest can't-yet, the
 * class's deterministic honest line (Instructions.ts ASK_HONEST_LINES — the
 * same vocabulary the generated capability section states) is rendered
 * instead.
 */

/*
 * The ask shapes, one per class. Each requires an ACTION word beside the
 * class noun, so "what would you do about email?" and "make me a workflow
 * that summarizes issues" classify as nothing and their turns stream
 * untouched.
 *
 * Two of the five nouns are also nouns for things the catalog CAN read, and
 * a loose action word beside them turns this gate into the censor §1 forbids:
 *
 *   "make me a workflow that summarizes open PRs"  — "make" … "PRs"
 *   "summarize the last push to main"              — "push" … "main"
 *
 * Both are ordinary, POSSIBLE asks (a run reads the loaded repositories),
 * and both keyed the impossible class, so the answer would have been replaced
 * with "I can't open a pull request" / "I can't push to a branch" — the truth
 * bar failing in the other direction, the app lying about what it cannot do.
 * So the two GitHub-noun patterns are written to the grammar that separates
 * the act from the reading:
 *
 * - `push` as a VERB, never the noun: "the/my/last/each push to main" is a
 *   thing that happened, "push my changes to main" is an act being asked for.
 * - `pr` requires the verb to GOVERN the PR ("open a PR", "file PRs for …"),
 *   never merely to appear within sixty characters of it; and "open PRs" as
 *   the adjective+noun state is not the verb "open" (see CLASS_EFFECT).
