/*
 * The boot gate for the persisted store: which backend holds it (E3.6) and
 * which shape version it was written under (E14.2).
 *
 * AppStore calls both halves before it constructs a single collection.
 *
 * The version half. TanStack's localStorage loader does not validate rows.
 * AppStore uses the validation gate, then opens TransactionalStorage
 * with the collection schemas before stamping the new version. Compatible
 * older rows survive; ordinary rejected rows are quarantined. Future versions
 * refuse open without mutation. A destructive reset requires the explicit
 * onMismatch: "reset" option. SQLite performs its own schema gate and
 * row validation in SqliteRowStorage.
 *
 * The backend half. AppStore can persist into either store, and it cannot
 * merge them. A launch that opens the store the previous launch did not write
 * reads an empty database and greets a returning user with a first-run app
 * while their whole transcript sits in the other one. `recordBackend` stamps
 * the store a launch committed to, and `readRecordedBackend` is what the next
 * launch honours.
 *
 * Both stamps live in localStorage, under the same prefix as the data, and
 * neither is ever cleared as data: they describe where the store is and what
 * shape it has, so losing them with a reset would strand the next launch.
