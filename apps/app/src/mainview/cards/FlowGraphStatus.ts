/*
 * What a run did to its graph: the pure fold.
 *
 * The `run-events` projection copies the engine's own journal onto the run,
 * verbatim, inside a `control.engine.event` envelope. Five of those event
 * types describe a graph rather than an execution: the plan record carries the
 * nodes and the edges, and the node records say when each one was scheduled,
 * re-keyed and settled. This module turns those rows into the state a card
 * draws, and touches no seam, no DOM and no layout engine, so the states are
 * provable against a recorded run (FlowGraphStatus.test.ts).
 *
 * The fold is keyed by EXECUTION, not by node id alone, because node ids are
 * addresses within one graph and nothing more: a recorded fixture run carries
 * four executions and every one of them names a node `root`. A card asks for
 * the execution that drove the plan it holds, or the one whose flow it
 * launched; `runGraphOf` is that question and it answers nothing when neither
 * is known, rather than guessing which graph the reader meant.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a state. The five outcome words are the engine's
 * (`built`, `clean`, `failed`, `skipped`, `deferred` — D-041), and a node with
 * no record of its own is `pending` until an evidence gap makes even that
 * unsayable.
