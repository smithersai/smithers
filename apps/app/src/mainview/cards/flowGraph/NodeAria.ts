/*
 * What a drawn node is, to a reader who is not looking at it.
 *
 * Both canvases draw the same box and both hand it to React Flow, which owns
 * the element a reader tabs to: it writes `aria-label` from the node's own
 * `ariaLabel` and spreads `domAttributes` last, so this is where the box's
 * role and its open state are stated (D-026: the state is a word before it is
 * a colour, and the word has to reach the accessibility tree too).
 *
 * WHY A BUTTON AND NOT AN OPTION. The canvas used to call itself a `listbox`
 * and the node card inside it an `option`, but React Flow's own wrapper
 * carries `role="application"` and sits between them, and neither its role
 * nor its position is configurable. A listbox that owns an application owns
 * no options at all, so a screen reader was told the graph was an empty list.
 * A node opens a drawer, which is what a button does, and `aria-expanded`
 * says which one is open.

 * Which node the browser focus is on, from the element a key event reached.
 *
 * React Flow owns the focus target — the wrapper, which carries the node id in
 * `data-id` — and the node card inside it carries the same id in `data-node`.
 * A key pressed on a focused node therefore arrives on the WRAPPER, where
 * `closest("[data-node]")` finds nothing, because the card is a descendant
 * rather than an ancestor. Reading both is what makes Enter work from the
 * keyboard as well as from a pointer inside the card.
 *
 * `data-id` alone is NOT the node wrapper: React Flow writes the same
 * attribute on every EDGE group, keyed by the edge id (`a-b`), and an edge
 * wraps its own label, which a pointer and the focus can both reach. Read
 * bare, a key pressed there answered with an edge id — a node id no graph
 * has — and the arrows walked from nowhere. The wrapper is the one React
 * Flow classes `react-flow__node`, so that is what is asked for.
