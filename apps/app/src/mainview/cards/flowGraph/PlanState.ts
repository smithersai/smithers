/*
 * Where a plan card ended up, as one closed set.
 *
 * A plan card carries the control plane's own vocabulary and nothing more:
 * `pending` while the ask is out, `done` with the nodes it answered, and
 * `failed` with the sentence whoever refused it wrote. That is three endings,
 * so this is three cases, and the fold below is exhaustive at compile time —
 * a fourth status on the wire fails `tsc` here rather than falling through to
 * a card that draws a plan it does not have.
 *
 * WHY A SENTENCE AND NOT A CODE. The refusals a plan can meet arrive with
 * different amounts of type behind them, and the card is handed the least of
 * them:
 *
 *  - The relay's workspace states — `provisioning`, `no-capacity`,
 *    `quota-exceeded` (apps/server/src/workflows.ts) — cross the wire as
 *    typed statuses and are collapsed into their `message` by the provision
 *    poll (state/controller/workflows.ts), which answers `true | string`.
 *  - A control-plane refusal carries a `code` on the seam's own result
 *    (state/controller/gateway.ts `GatewayResult`), which the plan settle
 *    does not keep.
 *  - A box older than a projection selector answers with a defect that
 *    carries NO code at all (packages/smithers/gateway/test/GatewayServer.test.ts),
 *    so no reader anywhere can branch on one.
 *
 * So the honest ending here is "refused, and here is what the workspace
 * said", with the door that asks again beside it. A fault class on the card
 * would have to be invented from prose, and an invented fault class is worse
 * than none.
