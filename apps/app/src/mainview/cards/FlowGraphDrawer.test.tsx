 * The node drawer, on both graph cards.

 * The run's evidence is the recorded one: `fixtures/GraphRunJournal.json` is
 * what a completed `gateway/GraphFixture` run wrote on the bridged stack, so
 * every action tag, effect set and journal row below is one the engine
 * produced. Where a case needs evidence the recording does not contain —
 * declaration provenance, which the engine writes today (D-037, D-047) but
 * this recording predates — the row is a RECORDED row with one field added,
 * and the test says which.
 *
 * A tab with nothing behind it is absent, never empty (D-035), so most of
 * what is asserted here is what the drawer does NOT draw.
