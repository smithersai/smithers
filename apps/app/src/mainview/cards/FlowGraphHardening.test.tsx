/*
 * The graph, hardened: what it does when it has nothing, when it is refused,
 * and what it says to a reader who is not looking at it.
 *
 * Three rules are pinned here, and each of them is a rule the rest of the
 * lane can only state once:
 *
 *  - A failure is visible and answerable. Every way a plan can fail leaves
 *    the card saying so, with the door that asks again beside it, and never
 *    a success state.
 *  - Nothing is a picture of nothing. A plan with no nodes draws no canvas
 *    and says no sentence about it (MINIMAL TEXT).
 *  - The state is a word and a role, never a colour. Every node is a
 *    focusable button carrying its tag, its id and its state word, so a
 *    screenshot and a screen reader read the same graph.
 *
 * The recorded run (`fixtures/GraphRunJournal.json`) is the evidence for
 * everything a run says; nothing below invents an event, an outcome or a
 * field the engine does not write.
