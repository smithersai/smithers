/*
 * The run's graph: the drawn half.
 *
 * Lazy on purpose (ViewModules.ts): `@xyflow/react` and `dagre` are the two
 * heaviest things this app can load, and a session that never opens a run's
 * graph must never pay for them. The shape and the states are proved in
 * FlowGraphStatus.test.ts and in the layout test beside this file, which run
 * without a canvas; this file is anatomy and a camera.
 *
 * React Flow is UNCONTROLLED here, as FlowGraphSurface.tsx set the precedent:
 * `fitView` and no `useReactFlow`, because apps/app bans `useEffect`. Follow
 * is the same trick — the canvas is keyed by the node it is watching, so a new
 * running node mounts a canvas that fits itself onto that node. Nothing here
 * holds state: what the camera is doing lives in the card payload.
