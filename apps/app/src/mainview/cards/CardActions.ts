/*
 * The CardView command bindings, built once per controller.
 *
 * Every act a card raises is a flow name, and the transcript (App.tsx) and a
 * card tab (tabs/CardTabBody.tsx) bind the SAME ones — the card in the tab is
 * a presentation of the card in the transcript, never a second implementation.
 * Both used to hold their own copy of the same eighteen inline arrows, and the
 * copies drifted: the tab never bound onFrameBack, onFrameForward or
 * onForkFrame, so the three frame controls a maximized card renders did
 * nothing there. Being fresh closures on every render, they also defeated
 * memoization — one streaming token re-ran the render function of every card
 * body in the transcript.
 *
 * Bindings are cached by controller and card record. Unchanged cards keep
 * the same callbacks through unrelated transcript renders, and replaced
 * records can be collected. Their origin affects presentation, never permission.
