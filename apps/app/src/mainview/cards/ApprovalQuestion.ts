/*
 * A gate that asks a QUESTION rather than for a grant.
 *
 * Most approvals are a capability the run wants allowed: Approve and Deny say
 * everything there is to say. A `HumanTask` gate is different — the run is
 * stuck on something only a person knows, and a decision answers nothing. On
 * Smithers Cloud, run-3 of `coding/request` asked "which service owns the
 * retry budget?" and parked forever, because even once the gate reached the
 * inbox there was no box to type the answer into.
 *
 * `waitRunId` is the gateway's marker for such a row: the wait is held by an
 * execution somewhere in the run's tree, and `request` carries what was asked.
