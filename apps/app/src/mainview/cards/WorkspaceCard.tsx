 * The workspace card (lane citc, ADR 0002; completed by lane L3): one
 * persistent cloud computer, reviewed in the transcript.
 *
 * The header names the repository, the target bookmark, the BOOKMARK's head
 * (labeled as such), and — since plue#446 — the facts the DTO now carries:
 * the sandbox kind, the workspace's OWN head, how far ahead of and behind the
 * bookmark it is, how long it has been up, the Nix environment it was built
 * from, its persistence, the languages it relays a language server for
 * (plue#505, `lsp: typescript`), and its ssh host as a copyable line. Every one of
 * them renders only when the payload carries it: an absent field renders
 * NOTHING, never a placeholder and never a zero that was not on the wire.
 *
 * The body is five facets: the terminal and its sessions, the working copy's
 * files (the same listing component the repository file card uses, imported,
 * with the rows bound to the workspace's own routes), the declared services,
 * snapshots with their acts, and the egress audit — what this computer called
 * and which secret NAMES the proxy swapped in, never a value.
 *
 * Every act binds a registered command through onRunCommand and carries
 * data-flow (parity.test.ts gates this). The one act whose door is the
 * host's — the terminal rides the origin's `/api/cloud-ws/` tunnel, which
 * the Worker does not open until the W4 relay lands — is rendered only when
 * the live registry holds `workspace.terminal` (parity-hosts.test.ts (a‴)):
 * the pointer path drops an unregistered name silently, so a button bound to
 * it would be a dead control.
