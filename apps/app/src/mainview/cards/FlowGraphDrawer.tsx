/*
 * One node of a graph, opened.
 *
 * Both graph cards drill into a node the same way, so this is one component
 * over one shape: a plan card's node (the control plane's keyed node, cut to
 * what a card carries) and a run's node (the graph the engine recorded, with
 * the state its records reached) reduce to `DrawerNode`, and the doors say
 * which card the acts address. Which node is open and which tab it shows are
 * facts on the card (state/controller/graph.ts); nothing here is component
 * state, so a poll, a reload and a restore all draw the same drawer.
 *
 * A tab with nothing behind it is ABSENT, never empty (D-035), and nothing is
 * completed into a value the engine never stated: the Code tab exists only
 * where a declaration site was recorded (D-037, D-047, D-054), Output only
 * where the settlement carried a result, Events only where the node has
 * records of its own, and Attempts only where the node's own record states
 * the step key digests it dispatched under (D-052). A box older than any of
 * those writes none of them, and the tab is simply not there.
 *
 * The journal is read here with the same narrowing RunTrace.ts uses rather
 * than a schema: a record this drawer cannot read is a record it does not
 * draw, never a hole in a fold.
 *
 * The Code tab is a VIEWER and not a door to one (D-054): it renders the
 * file card `files.read` wrote through the app's one code surface, which is
 * also what makes the hover and definition gestures work inside it. The read
 * itself belongs to the flow that opened the tab (state/controller/graph.ts),
 * so this component still reads nothing and holds nothing.
