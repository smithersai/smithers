/*
 * The vault kit's contract (packages/smithers/ui/src/vault/types.ts) served
 * from the Wiki pane's documents (the `worldDocuments` collection). The
 * backlinks rail, the outline and the knowledge graph render whatever a
 * VaultAdapter answers; this adapter answers the person's notes.
 *
 * Links are the `[[wikilink]]` targets each note already records
 * (`document.links`, written by the editor and by the chain's remember).
 * A target resolves to a note by path, by file stem, or by title; a target
 * no note answers stays in the graph as a node flagged `missing`, so a
 * dangling link is visible instead of silently dropped.
 *
 * write() is for notes only: generated pages (Librarian L6) do not exist in
 * this collection yet, and when they do they refuse here with the reason.
