 *
 * The split is deliberate. Flow IDENTITY (name, description, capabilities,

 * its projected descriptor. Everything below is UI-catalog copy about a flow
 * that already exists, which is why it can stay a plain structural record.
 *
 * The namespace rows, the requirement rows and the recommendation rows are

 * module aggregates them in display order. Those are the only value imports,
 * so a lane that adds a namespace, a requirement or a recommendation edits
 * its own module plus one line here.
