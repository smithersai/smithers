/*
 * The `search` flows (Search and Command Palette Spec 2026-09-07 §6): one
 * flow per palette prefix, each with its three doors. The palette is the
 * button door and reads the same seam synchronously; the slash and agent
 * doors run these handlers, which answer the items as data and, for a human,
 * embed the `search-results` card. A mode whose index does not exist yet is
 * registered and refuses with the exact reason (state/seams/SearchSeam.ts):
 * no door ever answers with rows it did not read. Qualifiers (`section:`,
 * `status:`, `is:`, `path:`) ride inside the query, as §1 writes them.
