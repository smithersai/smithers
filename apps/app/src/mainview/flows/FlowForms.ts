/*
 * THE FORM LAW (apps/app/AGENTS.md; docs/workbench-lanes/flow-forms.md): a
 * flow invoked without its required input renders a form for the missing
 * fields, never a usage sentence. The form is DERIVED here from the flow's
 * own input schema (the `Schema.Struct` every declaration in Flows.ts
 * carries), overlaid with the flow's optional `form` hints — labels,
 * placeholders, and the seam that supplies a field's options. No flow writes
 * a second hand-made form.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no DOM, no Effect runtime. The controller half
 * (state/controller/forms.ts) resolves option providers against the seams
 * and holds the draft in the card's payload.
