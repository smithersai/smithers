/*
 * One typed way to bind an affordance to a flow.
 *
 * Every visible affordance runs a registered flow, and it says which one in
 * `data-flow`. Nobody writes that attribute by hand: `flowProps` takes a
 * `FlowName` — the union derived from the registry — so a name the registry
 * does not declare is a type error rather than a button that does nothing,
 * and the attribute's spelling lives here alone. `flowAction` adds the click.
 *
 * A name that only exists at runtime (a repository's flow leaf, a projected
 * suggestion, a toast's action) cannot be checked against the union, so it
 * goes through the `dynamic*` pair. The escape hatch is named on purpose: a
 * plain string at a call site is visible as one.
