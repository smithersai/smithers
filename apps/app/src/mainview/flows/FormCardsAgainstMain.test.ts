/*
 * THE FORM LAW, measured as a DIFFERENTIAL over the WHOLE door space against
 * `main@origin`.
 *
 * Three passes of this chain shipped a rule stated over a class and tested on
 * a sample. R102 compared seven lines, R102b compared seven, and R102d's own
 * table compared eighteen; a reviewer who swept every (flow, args) pair found
 * that the rule those tables passed had deleted 81 distinct sentences over 87
 * flows — 1054 rows — while the report said it cost one. A differential over a
 * sample proves nothing about a rule stated over a class, so this file does
 * not hold a table of lines. It ENUMERATES: every flow the registry answers
 * with, times an argument set generated from that flow's own declared fields,
 * through the real door (`controller.renderFlowForm`), and compares every row
 * to the card `main@origin` opens for it.
 *
 * A flow added later is swept without anyone editing anything, and a flow the
 * baseline has never seen is still held to the law below rather than skipped.
 *
 * `FormCardsAgainstMain.main.json` is that baseline, captured through this
 * same harness at the `main@origin` its own `capturedAt` names. It was read
 * twice — at `0e876a2566fe` and again at `6cc28aec6f9a`, 41 commits later —
 * and all 8719 rows were byte-identical, so those 41 commits changed no card
 * and the baseline describes main today. Re-capture it with
 * `FORM_CARDS_BASELINE=write bun test src/mainview/flows/FormCardsAgainstMain.test.ts`
 * IN A WORKSPACE ON `main@origin` AND NOWHERE ELSE, and say in the commit
 * which revision it was read at — a baseline captured on a branch is the
 * branch agreeing with itself, which is the failure this file exists to stop.
 *
 * `DECLARED` is every move this branch makes on purpose, with the reason and
 * the number of rows it moves. A difference that is not declared, and a
 * declared move whose row count has changed, are both failures.
