/*
 * The rules the pin enforces, as pure functions over extracted literals and
 * derived vocabularies.
 *
 * Each rule closes one of the four classes the 2026-08-15 `command`→`flow`
 * rename left behind in `scripts/worker-e2e.ts` and the browser scripts:
 * eight dead flow names, nine comparisons against a card kind that no longer
 * existed, two dead run-card id prefixes, and seventeen `data-command`
 * selectors the app never emitted.
 *
 * A rule is only as good as the positions it looks in. The first cut of the
 * card-kind rule read two of them — `[data-kind="…"]` selectors and direct
 * `.kind ===` comparisons — and so reproduced, one level up, the defect the
 * pin exists to catch: a kind handed to `cardOfKind(client, "…")`, or written
 * into a scripted card frame, was never checked at all. The rule now reads a
 * kind wherever the file puts one. `Literals.ts` traces the value-carrying
 * positions; the card-frame position is decided here, because it needs the
 * wire model to say what a card object looks like.
