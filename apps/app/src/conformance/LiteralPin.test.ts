/*
 * The literal pin.
 *
 * A test suite asserts against the application with string literals, and a
 * string literal is invisible to the compiler. On 2026-08-15 a `command`→`flow`
 * rename orphaned nineteen literals in `scripts/worker-e2e.ts` and seventeen
 * `data-command` selectors across four browser scripts. Everything still
 * compiled, every suite still passed, and for three days the suite proved
 * nothing: nine `card.kind === "workflow-run"` comparisons could no longer be
 * true, and a stub emitting a tool call for `workflow.create` disarmed the very
 * substitution guard that section existed to prove.
 *
 * A one-off sweep fixes that Tuesday. This test fixes the class: it derives the
 * vocabularies from the application, extracts the literals from the suites, and
 * fails by name when one no longer resolves.
 *
 * It lives under `src/` so `bun test src` runs it in the fast unit gate on
 * every push. The rot it catches is cheap to detect and expensive to miss.
