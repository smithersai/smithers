 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO AXE SCAN. `axe-core` is in no lockfile in this repository
 * and this lane may not add one, so the rules it would have run are written
 * out below instead: the accessible name of every node, the role it exposes,
 * whether it can be reached and operated by keyboard, and the contrast of
 * every colour the graph paints. Each is asserted against the rendered tree
 * and the computed styles rather than against the source, which is what an
 * axe run would have done. `styles/paletteTokens.ts` holds the same floors
 * over the palette table, so the two agree cell by cell.
