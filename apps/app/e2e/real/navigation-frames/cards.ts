/*
 * THE FORM VEHICLE. The scenarios that open this form (navigation-frames.spec.ts,
 * navigation-recovery.spec.ts) are about card identity, frame history, tab
 * sessions and the physical OPFS database — not about the flow behind the
 * form. That flow is a VEHICLE, and it is chosen against three criteria,
 * never by convenience:
 *
 *   1. REGISTERED IN THE DEPLOYED BUILD. No release flag gates it, so a
 *      scenario driving it can honestly claim `host:production`.
 *   2. PROVIDER-FREE. Opening the form dials no model and no upstream, so a
 *      red here is the subject's fault and never a provider's.
 *   3. A REQUIRED INPUT. The form-draft, focus and fork scenarios need one
 *      field to hold an unfinished value across a frame transition.
 *
 * `tab.read` meets all three — `tabHarnessFlows` is registered
 * unconditionally in Flows.ts, its handler only reads local state, and its
 * `tab` field is required — and reading a tab mutates nothing if the form is
 * ever submitted.
 *
 * The vehicle was `wiki.open` until it failed criterion 1: the Wiki flows sit
 * behind VITE_SMITHERS_WIKI (Flows.ts), off in every deployed build, so they
 * are absent from the live `.app-shell[data-flows]` registry and nine
 * scenarios whose subject was never Wiki could not execute in production.
 * Re-point FORM_VEHICLE_FLOW and FORM_VEHICLE_FIELD to change the vehicle
 * again; the card and field ids below derive from them.
