/*
 * The one command: a credential-free real stack on localhost.
 *
 *   bun scripts/flow-graph-e2e-host.ts
 *
 * It prints the origin URL and holds it open until you stop it. Nothing it
 * starts needs a GitHub session, a Smithers Cloud workspace or a provider key.
 *
 * What it starts:
 *
 *   1. `flow-graph-e2e-gateway.mts` under tsx/Node, which holds the real
 *      control plane, the real engine over two SQLite files, the bridge, and
 *      the product Worker's relay in front of them. It prints its relay URL.
 *      `@smthrs/database` `NodeDatabase` refuses Bun, which is why it is a
 *      second process and not a layer in this one.
 *   2. the SPA build, unless SMITHERS_SKIP_SPA_BUILD=1.
 *   3. `startLocalServer` in hybrid mode with both upstreams pointed at that
 *      relay, so `/api/workflow/*` and `/api/auth/*` reach it and nothing
 *      leaves the machine. The cloud upstream is what puts `cloud` in the
 *      origin's bootstrap capabilities, and `flow.list`, `flow.run` and
 *      `flow.plan` each declare it, so an origin without one lists no flows.
 *
 * The gateway child dies with this process.
