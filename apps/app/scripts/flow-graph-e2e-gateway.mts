/*
 * Half one of the flow-graph e2e stack: the gateway, and the relay in front of
 * it.
 *
 * Run `bun scripts/flow-graph-e2e-host.ts` instead of this file. That is the
 * one command; it starts this process, reads the URL printed below, and points
 * the local origin at it.
 *
 * Why two processes. `@smthrs/database` `NodeDatabase` refuses Bun, and the
 * local origin is a Bun server, so the gateway cannot live in the same process
 * as the thing that serves the SPA. This half runs under tsx/Node and holds:
 *
 *   - the bridged stack (`packages/smithers/test/BridgedEngineRun.ts`): a real
 *     control plane, a real engine over two SQLite files, and the
 *     `EngineJournalSupervisor` bridge a deployed host wires;
 *   - `NodeGateway` on a loopback port, behind a bearer this process mints;
 *   - the product Worker's relay, with the Worker's own frame adapter
 *     (`smithers-server/gatewayRpc`), which holds that bearer.
 *
 * The relay answers `provision` as ready and `/api/auth/session` as the scoped
 * test user, so nothing here needs a GitHub session, a Cloud workspace, or a
 * provider key. Both halves die with the command that started them.
 *
 * It also stands in for the two product routes the Worker serves beside the
 * RPC seam, because the app calls them on its own origin and the local origin
 * forwards both here (`src/bun/server.ts` PRODUCT_PROXY_PREFIXES):
 *
 *   - `GET /api/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents[/path][?ref=]`, answered from
 *     the checkout this stack is running out of. The fixture flow is a file
 *     in this repository and a node record says which line of it the action
 *     was declared on, so the file a reader opens from a node is that real
 *     file. With `ref` it is the file AT that revision, read out of jj or
 *     git rather than off disk, which is what the Code tab asks for: the
 *     working tree moves, and this suite itself edits it;
 *   - `GET /api/workflow/triggers?repo=`, answered by relaying
 *     `List { _tag: "triggers" }` to the gateway and mapping the frame with
 *     the Worker's own `workflowTriggersFromFrame`, so the rows a card draws
 *     are the rows the trigger store holds;
 *   - `GET /api/workflow/trigger-registrations?repo=` and
 *     `GET /api/billing/balance`, the two routes a signed-in app reads on its
 *     own at boot. Left unanswered they were 404s, and the balance one put a
 *     red "Your balance couldn't be refreshed right now." toast over the page
 *     for the whole session. Both answer this stack's own truth below.
 *
 * `GET /api/repos` and `GET /api/harnesses` never arrive here: the local
 * origin proxies `/api/repos/` (with the slash) and nothing under
 * `/api/harnesses`, so both are its own 404 — the same answer the native
 * shell gives, because the local backend that served them was retired
 * (`apps/app/docs/LOCAL-BACKEND-RETIREMENT.md`). Neither is a failure the app
 * surfaces: `loadRepos` and `loadHarnesses` drop a non-ok answer in silence.
