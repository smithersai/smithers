/*
 * The end-to-end proof: this app's own gateway seam drives a run.
 *
 * The script stands up
 *
 *   - a real workspace gateway (`@smthrs/gateway` over a real SQLite control
 *     plane, journal, and run store) on a loopback port, behind a bearer
 *     credential;
 *   - the product Worker's relay, using the Worker's own frame adapter
 *     (`smithers-server/gatewayRpc`), which holds the credential the browser
 *     cannot;
 *   - this app's seam (`createGatewaySeam`), unmodified, pointed at the relay,
 *
 * and then does what a human does: list the flows, launch one, watch it,
 * approve the gate it parks on, read what a node produced, and cancel it.
 *
 * What is real and what is scripted. The gateway, the relay, the seam, the
 * control plane, and every mutation are real: each step below is an HTTP call
 * that crosses all three. The run's own ACTIVITY is scripted: only an agent
 * run parks on a permission gate, an agent run needs a provider credential
 * (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or another seat), and a proof that skipped without one
 * would prove nothing in the environments this is run in. So the turn, the
 * cell call, and the gate are journaled here with the exact payloads
 * `@smthrs/agent` `AgentSession` writes: `{seat, contextDigest}`,
 * `{flowName, input}`, `{flowName, outcome, message, value}`, and the
 * approval `AgentSession.authorize` registers. A run the durable engine really
 * executes is proven separately, in `packages/smithers/gateway/test/RealEngineRun.test.ts`.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the approval: ONE call decides the gate and
 * resumes the run. The relay counts every procedure it forwards, so a second
 * `Resume` would be visible here and fails the proof.
 *
 * And the plan: `Plan` answers with the keyed nodes the flow will run, which
 * is what the flow graph draws.
 *
 * Run it with: pnpm --filter smithers-app proof:gateway (tsx, not bun: the
 * script loads the workspace's TypeScript sources through tsx's loader).
