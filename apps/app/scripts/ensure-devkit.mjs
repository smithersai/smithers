/*
 * Electrobun 2.x ships no SDK in node_modules: Hutch projects it into
 * .hutch/devkit (gitignored) with `electrobun prepare`. tsconfig.json extends
 * the projected tsconfig and vite.config.ts imports the projected Vite
 * aliases, so a fresh clone or worktree cannot typecheck or build until the
 * projection exists. This script makes that step automatic.
 *
 *   node scripts/ensure-devkit.mjs          exit 1 when the devkit cannot be prepared
 *   node scripts/ensure-devkit.mjs --soft   warn and exit 0 instead (postinstall)
 *
 * Runs as `postinstall` (so `pnpm install` leaves a usable tree) and ahead of
 * every script that reads the projection (typecheck, start, build, the T1
 * web server, the T2 launcher). It is a no-op when the projection matches the
 * installed electrobun version. Plain ESM so node and bun both run it.
 * On a fresh machine the first `prepare` downloads Hutch and the Electrobun
 * release into ~/.hutch, which needs the network.
