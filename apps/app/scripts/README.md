# apps/app/scripts

E2E and live-check scripts. Unless a section says otherwise, run them from
`apps/app`.

## Declared test runners

| Command (from `apps/app`) | Files executed | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm test` | Tests under `src/`, `scripts/`, `e2e/contracts/`, `e2e/real/coverage/`, `e2e/real/support/`, and `e2e/real/auth-permissions/profile.test.ts` | Bun |
| `pnpm run test:e2e` | Specs under `e2e/playwright/` | Playwright Chromium and the local app server |
| `pnpm run test:e2e:auth` | `e2e/native/CloudAuthFragment.test.ts` | Playwright Chromium; starts isolated loopback OAuth fixtures |
| `pnpm run test:e2e:site` | Specs under `e2e/site/` | Playwright Chromium; builds and previews `apps/site` |
| `pnpm run test:e2e:probes` | Tests under `e2e/probes/` | Playwright Chromium; no server and no deployed host |
| `pnpm run test:e2e:packaged` | Bridge, fixture lease and packaged-app tests named by `e2e/packaged/run.ts` | Packaged Electrobun app |

Native process probes are Bun tests, separate from Playwright specs. `lint/conformance/TestInventory.test.ts`
checks that each test file belongs to an executable runner. The `unitTests`
target uses the same discovery as `pnpm test`; its inputs include scripts,
E2E harnesses, configs and RPC fixtures. It depends on the RPC, gateway and
shared UI typechecks so the inspected package sources contribute their keys.
The `browserE2e` target invokes `run-pr-e2e.mjs`, which installs Chromium, runs
`test:e2e:auth`, `test:e2e:probes` and `test:e2e:graph-lifecycle`, then the
offline Playwright, site and flow-graph suites. TestInventory admits a CI
browser tier only from that runner's argv, never from a `package.json` alias.
Any failed command stops the wrapper with a nonzero exit code.

## Launch checklist (`launch-checklist.ts`)

Run the signed-in launch checklist (§A-F) against an explicit origin.
`--target`/`-t` overrides `$CHECKLIST_TARGET`; there is no default target.

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm run checklist -- --target https://canary.smithers.sh
```

From `apps/app`:

```sh
pnpm run checklist -- --target https://canary.smithers.sh
```

The root script forwards to the UI package. Both commands run
`bun scripts/launch-checklist.ts` with `apps/app` as the working directory.
A local origin can be passed to `--target` for local verification.

### Probes and prerequisites

The §A, §B, §C and §F rows, plus D-3 and D-4's pause half, use a system
Chrome/Chromium through `headless-page.ts`. The §D HTTP rows inspect billing
and turn seams; §E inspects the billing upstream. D-4 checks both the turn
response and the workflow refusal at zero balance.

The checklist downloads no browser. Choose one with `--browser <path>` or
`$CHECKLIST_BROWSER`, or use automatic system-browser discovery. One browser
process serves the run, with a separate page per session cookie.
`--no-browser` skips browser prerequisites while HTTP probes still run.

Missing prerequisites produce `not-testable-yet` rows with a named reason.
A probe that starts but cannot decide also produces `not-testable-yet`, with
`undecidedInProbe: true`. These outcomes have different exit codes below.

### Auth material

The `CHECKLIST_*` credentials are auth material; never commit them.

| Variable | Rows | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHECKLIST_SESSION_COOKIE` | §A except A-1, §B, §C, §F, D-1, D-2, D-3 | Cookie header for a signed-in session |
| `CHECKLIST_ZERO_BALANCE_BEARER` | D-4 | Cookie header for an account at zero balance |
| `CHECKLIST_BILLING_UPSTREAM_URL` | §E | Billing upstream origin |
| `CHECKLIST_BILLING_ADMIN_TOKEN` | E-2, E-3 | Billing upstream admin token |
| `CHECKLIST_BILLING_PRODUCT_SERVICE_TOKEN` | E-3 | Product Worker billing service token |

Set cookie headers as `name=value; name2=value2`. Missing required variables
skip that row's prerequisites; the run continues and writes a report. A-1
checks the signed-out view without a cookie.

### Dry run

From either directory:

```sh
pnpm run checklist -- --dry-run
```

No target, credentials or browser are required. Dry runs make zero network
calls, mark every row `skipped-dry-run`, write both reports, and exit `0`.
They verify CLI wiring and report generation, not the deployed application.

### Output and exit codes

Every completed run writes `launch-checklist-report.json` and
`launch-checklist-report.md` under
`apps/reports/launch-checklist/<timestamp>Z-<dry-run|run>/`.
`--out <dir>` overrides the report directory; relative paths resolve from
`apps/app`, including when invoked through the root forwarding script.
Reports contain `generatedAt`, `target`, `totals`, and `rows[]`.

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | No failed rows and no run-mode probe-undecided rows. A run containing only passes and prerequisite-skipped rows also exits zero; zero alone does not prove every row ran. Dry runs exit zero. |
| `1` | At least one row is `fail`, even if other probes are undecided. Invocation without a target outside dry-run mode also exits one. |
| `2` | No failed rows, but at least one run-mode probe-undecided row (`undecidedInProbe: true`, counted in `totals.probeUndecided`). |

Prerequisite-skipped rows include missing auth variables and unavailable or
disabled browsers. Probe-undecided rows include an empty watched set or no run
identifier in the rendered state. Inspect row reasons and totals before
accepting a release. Connection failures from probes that run are failed rows.

The catalog, runner and CLI contract live in `./launch-checklist/`.
`pnpm test` covers them and the script contracts. The process shell owns the
clock, filesystem, browser lifecycle and final exit code.

## Live checks

`live-signed-in-check.ts`, `live-workflow-check.ts`, `canary-seam-probe.ts`,
`launch-seam-probe.ts` and `canary-browser.ts` inspect deployed hosts. Each
script's header states its required environment and evidence directory.

Install the browser with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.
`lint/conformance/LiteralPin.test.ts` checks suite literals against the product.
