/*
 * Every registered flow whose handler can reach a durable write, mechanically.
 *
 * The first sweep of this defect was done by reading the setup card and its
 * controller, and it missed `runs.open` — a button on that very card. A list
 * made by reading is a list of the doors somebody remembered. This one is made
 * by walking the two things that decide the answer:
 *
 *   1. `flows/entries/*.ts` declares every door a person can reach: a slash
 *      line, a palette pick, a card control. Each declaration names its
 *      handler as `actions.<member>`.
 *   2. `state/controller/*.ts` (plus AppController.ts) holds those members. A
 *      durable write is `.isPersisted.promise` — the only way this app waits
 *      for bytes — reached directly or through a helper in the same file.
 *
 * A member is attributed the writes of the nearest declaration above each
 * write site, then the call graph inside each file is followed (bounded, so a
 * cycle cannot spin) so helpers like `upsert` or `writeOrRefuse` carry their
 * writes up to the member that calls them.
 *
 * Run: bun run scripts/durable-write-doors.ts [--json]
