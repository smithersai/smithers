/**
 * Reports where a page presents a package the release does not publish as one

 * A manifest's `private` flag keeps a package off npm, and the roster in

 * gives a package its own heading, or an install command, promises both. This
 * reads the roster instead of restating it, so a package leaving the train
 * reddens the page that still sells it.
