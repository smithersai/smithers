/**
 * Targets for smithers.sh: the Astro site with the landing page, the /demo
 * request page, the Starlight documentation under /docs, the release
 * changelogs under /changelogs, and the product app prerendered at
 * /<owner>/<repo> for every catalog repository.
 *
 * The media the hero plays (public/media) is recorded, not built:
 * `scripts/record-tape.sh` runs real flows through vhs, and
 * `scripts/record-ui.mjs` drives the product UI under Playwright. Both need a
 * provider and a display, so neither is a target; the build ships whatever
 * recordings the tree carries.
