/**
 * Targets for the review application: two typechecks and the unit suite.
 *
 * Two typechecks because the app has two type environments and they are not
 * compatible. `src/` runs under Node — the bin is `bin/smithers-review.mjs`
 * and the durable runtime it composes needs Node's HTTP client — so it is
 * checked with `@types/node` alone. The suite runs under Bun, whose own types
 * redefine `process.env` in a way the workspace packages' own signatures
 * refuse, so it is checked separately with `bun-types` on top.
 *
 * Live GitHub suites require SMITHERS_REVIEW_E2E=1. Run `pnpm test:live`
 * separately with credentials; ordinary unit tests never contact GitHub.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
