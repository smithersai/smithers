# Review commands

Comment `@smithers review` on an open pull request to trigger the action.
The commenter must be an owner, member, or collaborator.

For a local walkthrough without model calls:

```sh
smithers-review /path/to/repo --no-review --no-narrate --quiz off
```

`--no-review` skips review agents. `--no-narrate` uses deterministic story order.
`--quiz` is independent of both flags and defaults to `auto`, which calls a
model for high or critical impact changes. Set `--quiz off` alongside both
flags for offline use. `--quiz on` forces quiz generation.

`--timeout <min>` sets a deadline for each file review, verification, narration,
and quiz action. The default is 10 minutes; values must be finite and at least
1 minute. Each action gets its own deadline, including model retries and schema
corrections. Expiry interrupts the call. A timed-out file becomes a
`subtask_error` warning; verification leaves findings unverified, narration uses
the deterministic story, and quiz generation returns no quiz.

The terminal and JSON run summary include each review warning. A failed
verification promotes an otherwise successful review to
`completed_with_warnings`, retains its findings, and identifies the verifier
seat and failure reason. The findings remain unverified.

The standalone HTML includes review status, warnings, and per-file coverage.
Failed, skipped, and partial reviews do not present zero findings as a clean
result. Files excluded from review or carrying file-review errors are marked
`not reviewed`; a file with errors may have been only partially reviewed.

`--out` (default `.smithers-review/walkthrough.html`) is replaced atomically.
Each render also retains an independent HTML file in `.smithers-review-artifacts/`
beside the output. The workflow returns that file as `walkthrough.artifactPath`;
`--publish` uploads it, so concurrent runs cannot swap published content.
The JSON summary exposes it as `walkthroughArtifactPath`. Retain these files
while a run may resume or publish; remove them manually when no longer needed.
Older recorded results without an artifact path must be rerun before publishing.

`--execution-id <id>` selects a durable review in `--db <file>` (default:
`<repo>/.smithers-review/review.db`). An unused ID starts a review. Without this
option, every invocation generates a fresh ID. The CLI prints the ID at startup
and on execution failure.

To recover after a crash, repeat the original command with its printed ID,
the same database and review options:

```sh
smithers-review /path/to/repo --db /path/to/review.db --execution-id review-recovery
```

The engine rejects an existing ID if the decoded review input differs,
including the repository, target, background, output, and review switches.
Keep the original seat configuration for unfinished model work. A settled
preparation preserves the original diff even when the working tree changes.
Settled file batches reuse their findings without another provider call;
in-flight calls may repeat. Before preparation settles, recovery can still
read the current tree. A completed execution returns its recorded result.
Use a fresh ID to review new changes. `--publish` and `--pr` reporting run
again after recovery when supplied; these external effects are outside the
durable review flow.
