/**
 * A real end-to-end review of a real pull request against live GitHub.
 *
 * The GitHub half is never faked: the PR is resolved, its files are listed,
 * and its head is fetched with the `gh` CLI, which authenticates from
 * `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` or from a `gh auth login` session. The model half
 * is credentialed separately: a live seat runs when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or
 * `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present, and a scripted seat otherwise, so the GitHub
 * contract is exercised even when no inference budget is available.
 *
 * `SMITHERS_REVIEW_E2E_PR` names the pull request (an `owner/repo#number` or a
 * URL); it defaults to a small, long-lived public PR.
