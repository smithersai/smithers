# Contributing to smithers review

Internals, architecture, and development workflow for `apps/review`. For
what the tool does and how to set it up, read the [README](README.md).

Design notes live beside the code. [src/README.md](src/README.md) maps the
review and walkthrough pipeline, [src/server/README.md](src/server/README.md)
maps the hosted service, and [docs/](docs/) holds the service contracts:
[OIDC sessions](docs/oidc.md), [proxy budgets](docs/proxy-budget.md), and
[hosted walkthroughs](docs/walkthroughs.md).

## How it works

One durable Flow, in four stages. `Flow.to` ends a round and starts the next
one with its payload as real data, which is what lets round 2 fan out over a
file list round 1 discovers:

1. `Review` resolves the target, filters files, and hands off. `ReviewFiles`
   then runs one `ReviewFile` cell per changed file, in `--concurrency`-wide
   batches, on the `review` seat with the prompt in
   `src/workflow/openCodeReview.ts`. Each batch runs in its own durable round;
   `MergeFileBatch` records its outcomes before a handoff starts the next batch.
   `--concurrency` bounds the simultaneous file-review calls per run (default
   8). Completed batches survive a resume. `VerifyReview` adjudicates the
   findings on the `review-verify` seat when `--verify` is on.
2. `collect-changes` loads the full diff for every changed file, including
   files the review filters skip (tests, docs, configs). The walkthrough shows
   everything.
3. `narrate` (an agent) writes the story as block streams: prose explanation
   (markdown), diff blocks that embed each file's diff at the right point in
   the narrative, and Mermaid diagrams wherever structure or flow changed.
   Chapters open with the central change and follow dependency order; prose
   between diffs carries the thread. `normalizeStory` enforces that every
   changed file appears in exactly one diff block; a deterministic fallback
   story covers agent failure and `--no-narrate`.
4. `walkthrough` renders self-contained HTML (inline CSS, no external assets)
   and writes it to `--out`. Diffs are rendered with `@pierre/diffs` (syntax
   highlighting, word-level diffs, line numbers, unified or `--split` view);
   diagrams render via an inlined Mermaid runtime (only included when the
   story has diagrams); the header shows a deterministic change-overview
   chart of additions/deletions by area, drawn as plain HTML bars.

Review findings never change the exit code; smithers review reports, humans
decide.

## Reviewing GitHub PRs

`--pr <number|url>` resolves the PR via the `gh` CLI, defaults the review
range to `origin/<base>..<headSha>`, and after the run posts one PR review:
the narrative summary (headline, synopsis, reading order, walkthrough link
when `--publish` ran) as the body, and every anchorable finding as an inline
comment with a ` ```suggestion ` fence when replacement code exists. If
GitHub rejects the inline batch, the findings are folded into the body and
the review still posts. The PR's head must exist locally (check out the
branch or fetch it first).

## CI

`.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` dogfoods the action in `action/` on this
repo. It is the README's workflow with the action pinned to a commit and one
job variable, the repository's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret. It stays on
`pull_request` and `issue_comment` (never `pull_request_target`) with
`id-token: write`, `contents: read`, and `pull-requests: write`.

`action/src/runAction.ts` runs these steps:

1. `action/src/gateEvent.ts` skips drafts, fork PRs, and comments other than
   `@smithers review` from an owner, member, or collaborator.
2. The job's GitHub OIDC token is exchanged for a review session at
   `/api/sessions` (`action/src/createSession.ts`). An unregistered repo, a
   spent monthly quota, or a `pull_request` event on a `comment`-mode
   registration ends the run with a notice, and the job passes.
3. `action/src/resolveInferenceEnv.ts` picks inference: the caller's
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, then `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then the service's metered
   proxy under the session token. Without the secret the review runs on the
   proxy; it does not skip.
4. `action/src/runReview.ts` runs the CLI with `--pr <number> --publish` and
   publishes to the session's `publishUrl` under the session token, so no
   publish secret exists.
5. The CLI posts the review onto the PR, and
   `action/src/upsertStatusComment.ts` keeps one status comment current with
   the outcome, the walkthrough link, and the remaining quota.

The action declares no outputs and uploads no run artifact: the PR review, the
status comment, and the hosted walkthrough are the whole result. A session
error or a failed review fails the job.

## Self-hosted CI (your own credentials)

To run reviews in another repo's CI without the hosted service, bring your own
provider key and check out smithers next to the repo. This path runs the CLI
directly and never calls the action or the service: there is no OIDC session,
no quota, and no hosted walkthrough.

```yaml
name: PR review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

permissions: {}

jobs:
  review:
    # Fork PRs have no secrets and a read-only token; drafts are not ready.
    if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository && !github.event.pull_request.draft
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6.0.2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # the review diffs origin/<base>..<head>; merge-base needs history
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6.0.2
        with:
          repository: smithersai/smithers
          path: .smithers-review-tool
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v6.0.8
        with:
          version: 11.25.0
          run_install: false
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6.4.0
        with:
          node-version: 22
      - run: pnpm -C .smithers-review-tool install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Review the PR
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: >
          node .smithers-review-tool/apps/review/bin/smithers-review.mjs .
          --pr ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY` works too; point `SMITHERS_REVIEW_SEAT` and
`SMITHERS_REVIEW_CHEAP_SEAT` at `openai:` seats when you use it. Never use
`pull_request_target` here.

## Rendering diffs anywhere else

The diff renderer is exported as `@smthrs/review/diffs`, so anything in this
workspace can embed the same diffs in any artifact (reports, custom workflow
UIs, dashboards). The package is private at rc.0, so the import resolves
through the workspace link, not a registry
install:

```ts
import { renderPierreFileDiff, extractDiffAssets } from "@smthrs/review/diffs";

const html = await renderPierreFileDiff({ diff: gitPatchForOneFile });
// embedding many diffs in one page? hoist the shared assets once:
const { sprite, styles, body } = extractDiffAssets(html);
```

The Pierre reference clone lives at `reference/pierre/` (gitignored).

## Publish service

`--publish` uploads the walkthrough to a Cloudflare Worker (R2-backed,
deployed with Alchemy from `alchemy.run.ts`) and prints an unlisted share
URL. The live endpoint is `https://review.jjhub.tech`; set
`SMITHERS_REVIEW_PUBLISH_URL` to the publish service endpoint before using
`--publish` ([hosted walkthroughs](docs/walkthroughs.md) covers the upload
contract). Credentials come from
`SMITHERS_REVIEW_PUBLISH_URL` / `SMITHERS_REVIEW_PUBLISH_TOKEN` or
`~/.smithers-review.json`.

```sh
REVIEW_PUBLISH_TOKEN=... pnpm -C apps/review deploy   # alchemy deploy
SMITHERS_REVIEW_E2E=1 pnpm -C apps/review test        # includes live publish e2e
```

## Seats

The flow declares four logical seats, so a step identity stays put when the
model behind it changes: `review`, `review-verify`, `review-narrate`, and
`review-quiz`. `src/workflow/reviewSeats.ts` reads the policy off the
environment and `src/workflow/reviewSeatResolver.ts` turns each
`provider:model` string into a credentialed route. It is the only file in the
app that reads a credential.

| Variable | Seats it sets | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SMITHERS_REVIEW_SEAT` | reviewing and verifying | `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| `SMITHERS_REVIEW_CHEAP_SEAT` | narrating and quizzing | `anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `SMITHERS_REVIEW_VERIFY_SEAT` | verifying only | `SMITHERS_REVIEW_SEAT` |
| `SMITHERS_REVIEW_NARRATE_SEAT` | narrating only | `SMITHERS_REVIEW_CHEAP_SEAT` |
| `SMITHERS_REVIEW_QUIZ_SEAT` | quizzing only | `SMITHERS_REVIEW_CHEAP_SEAT` |

The provider is the half of the seat string ahead of the colon, and it alone
decides which credential is read: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for `anthropic:` seats,
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for `openai:`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for `openrouter:`. A seat
with no colon is a bare model id on the Anthropic route. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
moves the Anthropic route to another origin, which is how the action reaches
the metered proxy.

The action chooses among three modes in `action/src/resolveInferenceEnv.ts`: a
caller's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (seats stay on their defaults), a caller's
`OPENAI_API_KEY` (both seats move to `openai:` models), or the metered proxy,
which mints a session-scoped key and points `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at its own
origin. Anthropic wins when both keys are set.

rc.0 runs no CLI subprocess, so there is no engine to select and no Codex or
Claude Code agent pool: a seat resolves to a provider route, and the table
above is the whole model policy. The 0.x variables that selected an engine and
its models are gone, and `tests/docsSeatConventions.test.ts` fails if this file
or the README starts documenting them again.

## Capabilities

`layerNode` runs the flow on the durable host, whose HTTP client is guarded by
the capability kernel: every model request is checked as `model:call` on
`<host>/<model id>`. `modelCallRules` in `reviewSeatResolver.ts` grants exactly
the origins the seats can dial, and `agentHost` declares the same patterns as
the run's capability envelope. Without the grant the first request parks on a
permission that an unattended run has nobody to answer, and the CLI dies with
"All fibers interrupted without error". Scripted seats build no HTTP request
and never meet the check, so `tests/workflow/reviewLayerNode.test.ts` drives a
real route against a local fixture provider to cover it.

## Documentation of exports

The workspace convention is JSDoc on every export, and the imported packages
follow it throughout. Here it is scoped to the published surface: the entry
points in `package.json`'s `exports` map (`./cli`, `./diffs`, `./workflow`,
`./workflow/layer`, and `./workflow/openCodeReview`) plus the modules the
diffs barrel re-exports. Those are the names another workspace project can
import, and `tests/publicApiDocs.test.ts` fails when one of them loses its doc
block.

Everything else under `src/` and `action/src/` is an internal seam between
files in this app. Document those where the reason is not obvious; a one-line
restatement of the signature is not required.

## Tests

```sh
pnpm -C apps/review test        # bun test: real git fixtures, real gh, real routes
pnpm -C apps/review typecheck
```

Suites that need a real backend go through `tests/support/liveSuite.ts`, which
prints one line naming what a skip did not prove. `tests/workflow/` covers the
flow on scripted seats; `tests/workflow/reviewLayerNode.test.ts` spawns Node
because the durable composition does not build under Bun.
