Every descriptor carries an `EffectDeclaration`: the paths the flow reads, the
paths it writes, whether those two sets are complete, what to do when two runs
collide, and a reversibility `tier`. Discovery derives all five without
evaluating anything, which is the constraint that shapes every rule here.

## The three tiers

| Tier           | What it claims                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sealed`       | Nothing has to be undone. Reading a file, a GET, a model call. |
| `compensable`  | Something was written, and the write can be reversed.          |
| `irreversible` | Neither of the above can be proven.                            |

The tier is inferred from the declared `capabilities` when the flow does not
state one. `fs:read`, `net:get`, `model:call`, `jj:status`, and `jj:diff`, plus
the bare tool names `read`, `grep`, `glob`, and `ls`, are sealed. A relative
`fs:write:<resource>` path is compensable. Everything else is irreversible, and
the inference takes the most conservative tier any one capability implies.

The compensable case is narrow on purpose. Only a relative path with no home
marker, no variable reference, and no URI scheme qualifies. `~/notes`,
`$HOME/notes`, `${HOME}/notes`, `%USERPROFILE%\notes`, `file:///notes`, an
absolute path, and a path that escapes the workspace with `..` are all
irreversible, because none of them can be checked back to a place the host
controls.

A flow may declare `effects.tier` itself. A declaration is accepted when it is
at least as conservative as the inference; one that under-classifies is
reported as `invalid_effect_tier` and the inference wins. An unrecognized value
becomes `irreversible` with the same warning.

## The conservative wildcard

When discovery cannot read a flow's authority, it reports the one value that
cannot understate it: wildcard capabilities `["*"]`, wildcard `reads` and
`writes` `["**"]`, `mode: "expected"`, `onConflict: "serialize"`, and
`tier: "irreversible"`. A declared `sealed` tier on such a flow is reported as
under-classifying rather than accepted.

Wildcard capabilities carry that whole projection, whichever way they arose. A
flow that declares `capabilities: ["*"]` and a flow whose capabilities
discovery could not read both project the wildcard effect set, because a
narrower `reads` or `writes` beside an unbounded capability list is a claim
discovery cannot check. Both body kinds decide this in one place, so equivalent
markdown and module declarations project the same effects.

A member the declaration leaves out is read the other way. An `effects` object
discovery can read, with no `reads` key, declares an empty read set rather than
an unknown one, because the author wrote the object and left the list out. Only
a member discovery cannot read widens to the wildcard.

The case both body kinds share is a **non-empty `flows` list**. The flow
delegates to another flow, and that flow's authority is not statically visible,
so a declaration cannot inherit what discovery cannot read.

The rest differ, because the two bodies say different things by staying silent:

| Situation                                        | Markdown flow                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Module flow                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No `capabilities` key                            | The wildcard, with an `unprojectable_authority` warning. A skill that says nothing about its authority is not a skill with none.                                                                                            | An empty list, with no warning. A `Flow.make` value that omits the field declared no authority, which the module's own effects then describe.        |
| A `capabilities` value discovery cannot read     | The wildcard, with `invalid_capabilities`. A space-separated string is accepted as the Agent Skills spelling, also with a warning, because that form is common in foreign skills and reading it is better than dropping it. | The wildcard, with `unsupported_module_metadata`. Anything but a string-literal array is unreadable without evaluating the module.                   |
| A spread or computed property in the declaration | Not expressible in YAML.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The wildcard, with `unsupported_module_metadata`, because the object's real members are not visible in the source text.                              |
| A default export discovery cannot read at all    | Not applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | No descriptor. The `unsupported_module_metadata` warning says the declaration could not be read, and the missing description then refuses the entry. |

Every module-side diagnostic in that table arrives under the single code
`unsupported_module_metadata`, carrying the specific message in its `message`
field. The markdown side spends distinct codes, because a skill author reads
them one at a time.

## Why the tier is not cosmetic

The tier is an admission contract. `Executable.dispatchedAction` puts
`effects.tier` on the action a bridged flow dispatches, and
[`@smthrs/engine-store`](https://engine-store.smithers.sh/reference/api/)'s `ActionPersistence` reuses a
`sealed` dispatch and nothing else. Projecting an indirectly writing flow as
sealed would do two wrong things at once: cache its result as reusable, and
disclose it to a model as read-only.

That is why a descriptor that names a delegate flow can declare a cache policy
and still never have a result reused. Its policy reaches admission and is
refused there. The descriptor whose result travels is the one whose own
capabilities project a `sealed` tier, with a `hermetic` effect declaration and
no globbed read set. See
[Reuse a discovered flow's result](/guides/reuse-a-flow-result/).

## Budgets are read the other way round

A markdown flow may declare the ceilings a control plane should approve for one
of its runs:

```yaml
---
description: Reviews a proposed change.
budget:
  tokens: 120000
  milliseconds: 900000
---
```

Both ceilings are positive safe integers. The two fields are the two fields of
a control-plane `Envelope.budget`, so a host projects them into an approved
envelope without reinterpreting either number, and
[`@smthrs/agent`](https://agent.smithers.sh/reference/api/)'s `Budget.layerFromEnvelope` turns that envelope
into enforcement at the model boundary.

A malformed budget is dropped rather than tightened, which is the opposite of
every other field here. The other fields have a conservative reading to fall
back on; a budget has none. Its conservative number is zero, and a zero ceiling
refuses the run's first call, so a typo would be reported as a spending
decision. Each of the two ceilings is read on its own, so an unreadable
`tokens` does not discard a valid `milliseconds`, and a key the budget does not
know is reported too, because a misspelled `tokens` would otherwise read as an
unbounded run in silence. All three cases are `invalid_budget` warnings.

An absent `budget` is not a zero. It is the absence of a ceiling, which
`Descriptor.budgetOf` answers with the named value
`Descriptor.budgetUnbounded`, so a host that gives up a ceiling can be seen to
have decided that rather than to have read an empty object. Every host builds
its envelope through `budgetOf` rather than by reading the field.

Module flows declare no budget. Discovery reads a `flow.ts` without evaluating
it, so `budget` is absent for every descriptor a module produces and the flow
runs unbounded unless its host supplies a budget of its own.

## Reading it back

- [Descriptors](/concepts/descriptors/): the value all of this lands in.
- [Delegation](/concepts/delegation/): what the declaration lowers onto at runtime.
- The [flow.mdx reference](https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/flow-mdx/): every frontmatter key an
  author may write.
