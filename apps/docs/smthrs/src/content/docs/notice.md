title: "Why importing smthrs throws"
description: "The notice smthrs@1.0.0-rc.0 throws, what each line of it means, why the package throws instead of resolving to an empty module, and the publication facts that make the notice reach a reader."

The whole of `smthrs@1.0.0-rc.0` is one error, raised while the module
evaluates:

```text
smthrs 1.0 is a migration notice, not a runtime.
Smithers 1.0 ships as @smthrs/* packages. Install @smthrs/flows (authoring and engine)
and @smthrs/cli (the `smthrs` command), then run `smthrs migrate` in a 0.x project.
Migration guide: https://smithers.sh/migration/1.0
```

Those four lines are the whole package.

## What each line means

**"a migration notice, not a runtime."** Nothing here runs a flow. The module
body throws and returns nothing to the importer.

**"Install @smthrs/flows and @smthrs/cli."** `@smthrs/flows` is the aggregate
that replaces the facade's runtime half: the authoring primitives, the durable
engine, and the stores. `@smthrs/cli` replaces its command half and publishes
the `smthrs` executable, with `smithers` as an alias of the same binary.

**"then run `smthrs migrate` in a 0.x project."** The upgrade is a source
migration, not a version bump. `smthrs migrate` scans the project, plans it as
units, and rewrites each unit against the 1.0 API.

**"Migration guide."** The procedure and the complete removal list live on
[smithers.sh](https://smithers.sh/docs/migration/1.0/). This site covers the package; that guide covers
the upgrade.

## Why it throws instead of resolving

The module declares no exports at all. Evaluation always throws, so a declared
export would be a name the published types offer and the runtime can never hand
back. That drift, a program that type-checks and then fails at run time, is
what the 0.x umbrella was guarded against, and it would be a strange thing for
its removal notice to reintroduce. The published `index.d.ts` declares no
importable surface, so a 0.x import fails to type-check as well as to run.

Throwing also puts the message where the failure is. A 0.x import that resolved
to an empty module would fail later, somewhere else, as an undefined value with
no explanation attached.

## How the package is published

Six manifest decisions carry the notice to a person rather than to a log
nobody sees.

| Decision                          | Why it is that way                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sideEffects: true`               | A bundler told this module is side-effect free may drop the import, and dropping the import drops the notice.                                                |
| `exports` is `.` and nothing else | Every 0.x subpath fails to resolve instead of resolving to something new. See [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/).                                       |
| No `bin`                          | The `smthrs` and `smithers` executables come from `@smthrs/cli`. A binary here would shadow them on every machine that installs both.                        |
| No dependencies                   | Installing the notice installs nothing else.                                                                                                                 |
| Both entry points throw           | `dist/esm/index.js` throws on `import`, and `dist/cjs/index.js` throws on `require`.                                                                         |
| `engines.node` is `>=26.4.0`      | Matches the [Node version Smithers 1.0 requires](https://smithers.sh/docs/migration/compatibility/). Lowering it would let the notice install where the packages it names cannot run. |

A dynamic `import()` rejects with the error rather than throwing at the call
site, because the throw happens while the module evaluates. A `require` of the
CommonJS entry throws where you called it. Both carry the same four lines.

A static named or default import never reaches the throw. Node rejects
`import { Workflow } from "smthrs"` while it links the module graph, before any
module evaluates, with a `does not provide an export named` SyntaxError that
carries no notice. Nothing in this package can run during linking, so that
error is documented rather than avoided; see
[Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/).

## Only `smthrs@next` reaches the notice

`smthrs@0.35.0` keeps the `latest` dist-tag until Smithers 1.0.0 is final, so
`npm install smthrs` still installs 0.x. Release candidates publish under the
`next` dist-tag, so `smthrs@next` and `smthrs@1.0.0-rc.0` are the two
specifiers that reach this package.
