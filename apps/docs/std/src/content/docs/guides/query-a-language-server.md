`lsp` is one flow with ten operations. It answers the questions a text search
cannot: where a symbol is defined, who calls it, what type it has.

## Spawn a server

`NodeLanguageServer` speaks framed JSON-RPC over ordinary stdio pipes, spawned
through [`@smthrs/kernel`](https://kernel.smithers.sh/reference/api/)'s `ChildProcessSpawner`. No terminal is
involved.

```ts
import * as NodeLanguageServer from "@smthrs/std/NodeLanguageServer"

const server = NodeLanguageServer.layer({
  command: "typescript-language-server",
  args: ["--stdio"],
  cwd: "/workspace",
  environment: { NODE_ENV: "development" },
  timeoutMs: 30_000
})
```

The layer sends `initialize` with `cwd` as the root URI and then `initialized`,
so the service is ready when it resolves. `timeoutMs` defaults to 30 seconds and
bounds every request as well as every write to the server's standard input.
The child inherits only `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `TERM`, `TMPDIR`,
and `SHELL`, with credential-shaped names withheld. Declare other names through
`environment`; explicit values override the allowlist.

A host with no server binds `LanguageServer.layerNoop`, and every operation
fails with `unsupported`.

## Run a query

```ts
import * as Lsp from "@smthrs/std/Lsp"

const definition = Lsp.run({
  operation: "definition",
  path: "/workspace/src/widen.ts",
  line: 12,
  character: 17
})
// definition.result is the server's own answer, passed through unchanged
```

| Operation               | What it takes               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `hover`                 | `path`, `line`, `character` |
| `definition`            | `path`, `line`, `character` |
| `references`            | `path`, `line`, `character` |
| `implementation`        | `path`, `line`, `character` |
| `prepareCallHierarchy`  | `path`, `line`, `character` |
| `callHierarchyIncoming` | `path`, `line`, `character` |
| `callHierarchyOutgoing` | `path`, `line`, `character` |
| `documentSymbols`       | `path`                      |
| `diagnostics`           | `path`                      |
| `workspaceSymbols`      | `query`                     |

`line` and `character` are **1-based**, which is how `read` and `grep` report
them, so a hit from a search is a position you can pass straight in. The flow
converts to the protocol's 0-based coordinates for you.

`path` must be a normalized absolute path. A relative path, or a missing one for
any operation except `workspaceSymbols`, fails with `invalid_input`, as does a
position operation missing `line` or `character`.

`references` includes the declaration. The two call-hierarchy directions run
`prepareCallHierarchy` first and return an empty array when the server prepares
no item, so a position that is not a callable is an empty answer rather than a
failure.

## The result is not a schema

`Output` is `{ result: unknown }`. The server's answer is passed through in the
server's own shape, because LSP responses vary by server and by version, and
narrowing them here would be a second, staler schema. Decode it on the caller's
side against what the server you bound actually returns.

## Bounds a server cannot exceed

The client refuses a malformed or oversized stream rather than growing without
limit:

| Bound                                     | Value                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| One JSON-RPC frame body                   | 8 MiB                                               |
| One frame's headers                       | 8 KiB                                               |
| `NodeLanguageServer.MAX_QUEUED_FRAMES`    | 256 frames buffered for the server's standard input |
| `NodeLanguageServer.MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS` | 512 concurrent in-flight requests                   |

Every queued write uses the request timeout, so a server that stops reading
produces a typed `timeout` rather than an unbounded queue or a new hang. Process
exit or a closed stdout fails every pending request after at most 100 ms for
stderr to finish draining.

Request errors include the protocol `method`. A server refusal keeps its numeric
code, message, and optional data in `StdError.rpcError`; the response frame limit
bounds that data. The main error message also includes the server message.
`StdError.stderr`, when present, contains the latest stderr tail, captured from
at most 64 KiB. Initialization failures and exits retain this diagnostic context.

## Bring your own server

`LanguageServer` is an ordinary service interface with ten methods, each taking
a `Position` (`path`, `line`, `character`) or a string. A host with its own
client, in-process index, or remote service implements those ten methods and
binds them with `LanguageServer.make`. Nothing above the service knows which one
answered.

One detail to implement against: a `Position` reaching the service is already
**0-based**. The 1-based to 0-based conversion happens in the flow, so the
service speaks the protocol's own coordinates.
