Network access is Effect's `HttpClient`, and the kernel decorates it. There is
no Smithers transport port beneath it, because a raw port would be a second way
to reach the network whose contract never mentions permission.

## What a request is checked as

The decorator derives one capability per request:

| Request                           | Action       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `GET` or `HEAD`                   | `net:get`    |
| Every other method                | `net:post`   |
| Any method inside `withModelCall` | `model:call` |

The resource is the URL host, and the scheme decides how it is written:

- For an `https:` URL, the resource is the **lowercased host** alone:
  `https://API.Example.test/v1/x` names `api.example.test`.
- For every other scheme, the resource is `<scheme>//<lowercased host>`:
  `http://API.Example.test/x` names `http://api.example.test`.

`https` is therefore the implicit scheme, and a grant for `api.example.test`
can never authorize a cleartext `http` downgrade to the same host. The path,
the query, and the headers are not part of the resource.

A URL that is not absolute and parseable fails with `permission_denied` and
the reason `"HTTP capability checks require an absolute, parseable URL"`.

## Mark a model call

The same host answers many models, and a grant for one must not be a grant for
the rest. Effect's tag has no room for an extra method, so the intent rides on
a context reference:

```ts
import { HttpClient } from "@smthrs/kernel"

const call = provider.chat(request).pipe(
  HttpClient.withModelCall("anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5")
)
```

Every outgoing request inside `call` is checked as `model:call` on
`<resource>/<model id>`, so the example asks for
`api.anthropic.com/anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5` rather than for the host in
general. The reference is `HttpClient.ModelCall` if you need to read it.

## Every redirect hop is checked

A redirect is a second network destination, so it needs a second grant check.
Two halves guarantee it:

1. The client below the decorator must **not** follow redirects on its own:
   Undici with no redirect interceptor, or Effect's fetch layer with
   `redirect: "manual"`. The decorator forces `redirect: "manual"` on the
   `RequestInit` of every request it executes, so a plain
   `FetchHttpClient.layer` cannot walk to another origin either. A custom
   client that ignores `RequestInit` must meet the precondition itself.
2. The decorator composes Effect's `followRedirects` **above** the guard, so
   every hop re-enters the guarded path and is checked exactly like hop zero.

An authorized origin cannot lend its grant to another.

## Read a refusal back

Effect's tag fixes the error channel to `HttpClientError`, so a refusal arrives
projected. The reason is always a `TransportError`: the request did not leave
the host. `description` carries the human rendering, and `cause` carries the
structured kernel failure:

```ts
import { HttpClient } from "@smthrs/kernel"
import { Option } from "effect"

const permission = HttpClient.fromHttpClientError(failure)
// Option.some({ code, capability, tier, requestId, ... })
```

`Option.none()` means the failure was a genuine transport problem, not a
permission decision.

## Requests are snapshotted

A request record a caller still holds is a way to change the destination after
it was authorized. The decorator snapshots the URL parameters, the headers, and
the body, copying byte buffers and form data, before any permission suspension.
A body that is neither immutable nor copyable fails with
`"HTTP request must be an immutable supported request description"`.

## Hosts with no network

`HttpClient.layerNoop()` provides a client whose every request fails with a
`TransportError` naming the request and the cause
`"HTTP is unavailable on this host"`. Use it for a host that genuinely cannot
reach the network, so an unconfigured capability answers rather than vanishing.
`@smthrs/testing/TestHost` composes it.
