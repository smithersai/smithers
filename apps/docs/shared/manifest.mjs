/**
 * manifest.mjs
 *
 * The roster of the per-package documentation sites under apps/docs/. Every
 * script in this directory (gen-sites.mjs, sync-content.mjs,
 * add-readme-doc-links.mjs) reads this list and nothing else, so adding a
 * package's site is one row here plus a generator run.
 *
 * Each row is [slug, npm name, source package dir]. The slug is the site
 * directory under apps/docs/ and the subdomain under smithers.sh
 * (<slug>.smithers.sh). The description is read live from the source
 * package's package.json, so a description edit there is the only edit a
 * package makes; gen-sites.mjs --check reports the generated files that the
 * edit puts out of date.
