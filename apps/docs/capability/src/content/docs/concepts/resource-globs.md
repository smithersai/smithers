A capability pattern is an action selector and a resource glob. The action
selector is one of an exact action (`fs:read`), a namespace family (`fs:*`), or
the whole-authority `*`. The resource glob is matched against the whole
resource, and this page is about that half.

## The grammar

| Form                        | Matches                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| a literal character         | itself, byte for byte over UTF-16 code units                                               |
| `*`                         | any run of code units, path separators and newlines included                               |
| `?`                         | exactly one code unit, so an astral character such as an emoji needs two                   |
| a space then `*` at the end | additionally, the bare resource with no trailing text, so `npm *` also grants `npm`        |
| `**`                        | the same as `*` when matching; beyond equality, the only form `Capability.subsumes` proves |

Every other character is literal. `.`, `+`, `(`, `[`, `^`, `$`, and `|` have no
special meaning: the matcher is a two-pointer glob walk, not a regular
expression, so a pattern like `a*a*a*a*b` is linear work rather than a
backtracking hazard.

```ts
import { Capability } from "@smthrs/capability"

const grant = new Capability.CapabilityPattern({ action: "proc:spawn", resource: "npm *" })

Capability.matches(grant, Capability.make("proc:spawn", "npm"))
// true
Capability.matches(grant, Capability.make("proc:spawn", "npm install pkg"))
// true
Capability.matches(grant, Capability.make("proc:spawn", "npmx"))
// false
```

The optional trailing wildcard exists so a command grant reads the way an
operator writes it. `npm *` means "npm, with any arguments", including none.

## Edge one: there is no escape

The grammar has no escape character, so a resource that genuinely contains `*`
or `?` cannot be granted exactly. This is the sharpest edge in the package,
because the pattern still looks exact:

```ts
Capability.matches(
  new Capability.CapabilityPattern({ action: "net:get", resource: "https://api.test/v1?k=1" }),
  Capability.make("net:get", "https://api.test/v1Xk=1")
)
// true
```

The operator wrote a URL and got a one-character wildcard. Two rules follow.
Never build a pattern by concatenating text an agent supplied, and derive exact
grants with `Capability.patternFromCapability`, which returns `Option.none()`
for a resource the grammar cannot express. The procedure is in
[Grant a capability safely](/guides/grant-a-capability-safely/).

## Edge two: the text is compared exactly

Matching performs no path normalization and no case folding. A backslash is an
ordinary character that never matches `/`, `A:/x` never matches `a:/X`, and
`/workspace/**` does not cover `/workspace\evil`:

```ts
Capability.matches(
  new Capability.CapabilityPattern({ action: "fs:write", resource: "/workspace/**" }),
  Capability.make("fs:write", "/workspace\\evil")
)
// false
```

That is deliberate. Normalizing slashes once turned `C:/x\..\..\etc\passwd`
into a path inside a `C:/x/**` grant. The supported hosts are POSIX, so the
matcher treats every resource as opaque text and leaves canonicalization to the
adapter that builds the capability. If your resources need normalizing, do it
before you construct the `Capability`, once, in one place.

## Edge three: matching and proving are not the same

`Capability.matches` decides one request. `Capability.subsumes` asks a
different question: does this pattern provably cover that whole set. It is
conservative and answers `false` for any relationship its syntactic checks
cannot prove, which is what a capability envelope needs.

`subsumes` proves a resource relationship in exactly three cases: the two
resources are identical, the covering resource is `**`, or the covering
resource ends in `/**` and the covered resource starts with that prefix and a
separator. A single `*` qualifies only through the first case, so it proves
the identical pattern and nothing else:

```ts
const wanted = new Capability.CapabilityPattern({ action: "fs:read", resource: "/workspace/src/a.ts" })

Capability.subsumes(
  new Capability.CapabilityPattern({ action: "fs:read", resource: "/workspace/*" }),
  wanted
)
// false
Capability.subsumes(
  new Capability.CapabilityPattern({ action: "fs:*", resource: "/workspace/**" }),
  wanted
)
// true
```

So `/workspace/*` matches `/workspace/src/a.ts` but can never be shown to cover
it. A run whose envelope is built from `*` patterns asks for permission it
already has every time a request names any resource other than the `*` pattern
itself. Write `**` whenever a pattern has to prove coverage.

Action selectors follow the same shape: `*` covers everything, `fs:*` covers
every `fs:` action and `fs:*` itself, and an exact action covers only itself.

## Cost and the bound

Matching costs O(pattern length times resource length) in the worst case. Both
resources are capped at `Capability.maxResourceLength` (4096 UTF-16 code
units) at construction, parsing, and decode, so an adapter must reject or
summarize a longer host value before authorization rather than carrying it in.

`Capability.maxMatchWork` is the square of that cap and guards structural
inputs that evaded the check. `Capability.matches` returns `false` past the
budget, because a grant must never widen, and `Permission.evaluate` turns the
same case into `deny`. `Capability.withinMatchBudget` reports whether a pair is
decidable at all.
