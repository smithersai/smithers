There are two tiers of sandboxing in this stack, and mixing them up is the
usual source of confusion.

`Sandbox.layerHost` from [`@smthrs/sandbox`](https://sandbox.smithers.sh/reference/api/) places a body's
**side effects** on a machine. The action's TypeScript keeps running in the
engine host; only its file operations and child processes are routed to a held
session.

`@smthrs/flows/SandboxedFlow` is the tier above it. The child flow's **own
code** executes inside the guest. Its TypeScript never runs in the parent's
process. A provider is a `Sandbox.Provider` value you pass in, never a string
looked up in a registry, and the authoring is `Flow.make` and `Action.make`, so
a sandboxed child is declared the same way every other flow is.

## The five steps

Every `SandboxedFlow.execute` call runs this sequence inside one acquired
session. The protocol's own files live in `.smithers-sandbox/` under the session
workdir.

| Step    | What happens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bundle  | esbuild bundles the `entry` module (`platform: "node"`, ESM) together with the guest runner into one self-contained `.smithers-sandbox/bundle.mjs`.                                                                                                                                            |
| request | The host writes `.smithers-sandbox/request.json`, holding `{ flow, executionId, payload }`: the flow's tag, the session key as the guest execution id, and the payload encoded through `Schema.toCodecJson` of the flow's payload schema.                                                      |
| run     | The guest runtime (`node` by default) runs the bundle with the workdir as its working directory and `SMITHERS_SANDBOX_REQUEST_PATH` and `SMITHERS_SANDBOX_RESULT_PATH` set.                                                                                                                    |
| guest   | The runner finds the flow by tag among the entry module's exports, decodes the payload, runs the flow, and writes `.smithers-sandbox/result.json`: `{ status: "succeeded", output }` with the success value encoded through the success schema's JSON codec, or `{ status: "failed", error }`. |
| result  | The host refuses a non-zero exit, a missing or unparseable result, and a result over the limits, then decodes `output` through the same codec. Every refusal is a typed `SandboxedFlowError`.                                                                                                  |

Payload and output both cross the machine boundary through a schema round trip
on each side, never a cast. The wire codecs are service-free, the same erasure
the interpreter performs for a handoff, because a JSON codec that needs a
service to encode has no way to be satisfied on the other side of a machine.

## What the entry module must export

The entry exports the flow under any name, default export included. It may also
export `layer`, an Effect `Layer` providing the implementations of the actions
the flow's body names and the `Interpreter.layer` registration of any flow it
calls as `.child()`. An entry with no `layer` export is fine when the flow's
body needs no implementations.

## The guest composition is in-memory on purpose

Inside the guest, the flow runs under `FlowEngine.layerMemory` with
`Interpreter.layer`, `Action.layerImplementations`, the entry's own `layer`, and
a `Crypto` built on WebCrypto, which Node 26 and Bun both expose as
`globalThis.crypto`.

That is the smallest composition in the tree that drives a flow to completion
with no host services, and it is the right one here: the child completes inside
one guest process, and the parent journals the whole sandboxed execution as one
durable action. An in-guest SQLite journal would put `node:sqlite`, the
migration ladder, and a `Jj` stub into every bundle without changing the
durability the parent can observe.

The guest's digests still agree with the host's: a child execution id derived in
the guest for a `.child()` boundary is the same SHA-256 the host would derive
from the same material, so a nested child is identified identically on either
side of the machine boundary.

## Failures split two ways

The guest distinguishes outcomes the protocol can state from failures of the
protocol itself.

A flow that failed, a payload its schema refuses, and an entry module that
exports no flow of the requested tag are all statable outcomes: the guest writes
a `failed` result and exits normally, and the host reports `flow_failed` with
the child's error as its tag and fields rather than a stack trace into the
bundle.

A missing request path, an unreadable request file, or a result that cannot be
written are failures of the protocol. The guest throws, the process exits
non-zero, and the host reports the exit code and the guest's stderr instead of a
fabricated result.

## What the guest image must contain

The runtime the bundle is started with has to be on the guest's `PATH`: `node`
22 or later, or `bun`. Nothing installs one. A missing runtime is a
`guest_failed` failure that names it, so `node:22-alpine` works and bare
`alpine` does not.

The entry's imports of `effect`, `@smthrs/flow`, and `@smthrs/engine` must
resolve to the same installation the host's `@smthrs/flows` uses. One installed
version of each in the project that bundles the entry is what gives you that;
two copies of `effect` in one bundle produce a schema that refuses its own
payload.

## A session key is an exclusive claim

The `session` option is the key the machine is acquired under, and it is
exclusive. Two live executions sharing one key share a machine, and the first to
finish tears it down under the other.

Reusing a key is what resume looks like. A normal completion releases the
session, which removes the workspace; only a host crash leaves a machine behind,
and the next execution with the same key reattaches it, workspace included. That
is why deriving the key from the parent execution id is the recommended shape:
it is unique per execution and stable across a resume.

## One action for the parent

`SandboxedFlow.action(flow)` declares an ordinary durable action over the
child's payload schema, whose success is `{ output, diff }` and whose error is
`SandboxedFlowError`. From the parent's point of view the whole sandboxed
execution is one step: the engine journals one attempt, applies one retry
policy, and replays one recorded result. A second run of the parent over the
same database answers from the journal without acquiring a machine at all.
