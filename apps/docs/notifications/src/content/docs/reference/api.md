Every module is importable as a namespace from the root entry point and from its
own subpath:

```ts
import { Alerts, Notification, NotificationQueue } from "@smthrs/notifications"
import * as SteerPayload from "@smthrs/notifications/SteerPayload"
```

Types written below as `Schema` are `effect` schemas; each one exports a value
and a type of the same name, and the type is the decoded form.

## NotificationQueue

Journal-backed durable admission and turn-boundary drain. Import from
`@smthrs/notifications/NotificationQueue`.

### Service

```ts
interface Service {
  readonly admit: (
    runId: string,
    notification: Notification.Notification
  ) => Effect.Effect<AdmissionReceipt, Journal.JournalError | NotificationError>
  readonly drain: (
    input: DrainInput
  ) => Effect.Effect<DrainReceipt, Journal.JournalError | NotificationError>
  readonly pending: (
    runId: string
  ) => Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<Notification.Notification>, Journal.JournalError | NotificationError>
}
```

| Method                       | What it does                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admit(runId, notification)` | Decodes the notification, snapshots it, and records one admission decision for `runId`. Idempotent on `notification.id`.     |
| `drain(input)`               | Promotes what the boundary named by `input` may deliver, and records the promotion. First writer wins on the drain identity. |
| `pending(runId)`             | Returns the run's admitted but unpromoted notifications, in admission order, across every lineage.                           |

`NotificationQueue` is the service tag, a `Context.Service` under the key
`/notifications/NotificationQueue`.

### AdmissionReceipt

```ts
interface AdmissionReceipt {
  readonly notificationId: string
  readonly decision: NotificationState.AdmissionDecision
  readonly seq: number | undefined
  readonly duplicate: boolean
}
```

| Field            | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `notificationId` | The `id` of the notification this receipt answers for.                                                                       |
| `decision`       | `admitted`, `coalesced`, or `rejected-full`. A caller MUST read it: `rejected-full` means the queue retained nothing.        |
| `seq`            | The journal sequence the admission committed at. Absent exactly when nothing was written, which today means `rejected-full`. |
| `duplicate`      | The id had already been admitted. `decision` and `seq` are read back from the committed record rather than recomputed.       |

### DrainInput

```ts
interface DrainInput {
  readonly runId: string
  readonly targetLineageId: string
  readonly boundary: string
  readonly wouldIdle: boolean
  readonly cutoffSeq?: number | undefined
}
```

| Field             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runId`           | The run whose journal holds the notifications.                                                                                                                |
| `targetLineageId` | The lineage this boundary belongs to. Notifications for other lineages are left pending.                                                                      |
| `boundary`        | The name of this safe point. With `runId` and `targetLineageId` it is the drain identity.                                                                     |
| `wouldIdle`       | Whether the run would have nothing to do if this boundary delivered nothing. When true and no steer was promoted, one queued notification is promoted.        |
| `cutoffSeq`       | The journal sequence that opened this turn. Steers admitted after it are held for the next boundary. Omitting it delivers everything pending for the lineage. |

### DrainReceipt

```ts
interface DrainReceipt {
  readonly notifications: ReadonlyArray<Notification.Notification>
  readonly boundary: string
  readonly duplicate: boolean
}
```

`notifications` are the ones the committed promotion record names, so two
processes draining one boundary report the same delivery. `duplicate` is true
when the boundary had already drained.

### NotificationError

```ts
class NotificationError extends Schema.TaggedError<NotificationError>()(
  "/notifications/NotificationError",
  {
    code: "notification_unavailable" | "notification_id_reused" | "notification_invalid"
    message: string
    notificationId?: string
    path?: string
  }
) {}
```

| Field            | Meaning                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`           | The stable half, and the one to branch on. Defaults to `notification_unavailable`. |
| `message`        | Human-readable detail. Never carries the offending value.                          |
| `notificationId` | The notification the failure is about, when one was readable.                      |
| `path`           | Dotted path of the offending field, for `notification_invalid`.                    |

| Code                       | Means                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `notification_unavailable` | The seam serves nothing, or the journal identity for a drain holds an event this queue did not write. |
| `notification_id_reused`   | A stable id was already admitted with different content. A producer bug, not a storage failure.       |
| `notification_invalid`     | The value is not a notification. `path` names the field that failed.                                  |

Storage failures surface as `Journal.JournalError` instead, so the two stay
distinguishable.

### Constructors and layers

| Export      | Signature                                                                               | What it provides                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make`      | `(implementation: Service) => Service`                                                  | The service, from an implementation of its three methods.                                                           |
| `makeNoop`  | `(overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Service`                                             | A service whose every method fails with `notification_unavailable`, except the ones `overrides` replaces.           |
| `layerNoop` | `(overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Layer<NotificationQueue>`                            | `makeNoop`, as a layer. Requires nothing.                                                                           |
| `layerWith` | `(options?: { capacity?: number }) => Layer<NotificationQueue, never, Journal.Journal>` | The journal-backed implementation at the given pending capacity, defaulting to `NotificationState.defaultCapacity`. |
| `layer`     | `Layer<NotificationQueue, never, Journal.Journal>`                                      | `layerWith()`: the journal-backed implementation at the default capacity.                                           |

Both journal-backed layers write through the journal's unfenced durable channel,
so `admit` and `drain` return only after the corresponding entry is committed.
The channel is unfenced on purpose: the notifying process owns no run, so there
is no ownership fence to hand over, and both records are first-writer-wins on
their own identity instead.

## Notification

The durable notification payloads and their admission classification. Import
from `@smthrs/notifications/Notification`.

### Schemas

| Export          | Shape                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Provenance`    | `{ sourceRunId: string; sourceLineageId: string; sourceTurn: number; sourceActor: string }`. `sourceTurn` is an integer at or above zero. |
| `HumanSteer`    | Tagged `"human-steer"`. The common fields plus `delivery: "steer"`.                                                                       |
| `HumanFollowup` | Tagged `"human-followup"`. The common fields plus `delivery: "queue"`.                                                                    |
| `SystemEvent`   | Tagged `"system-event"`. The common fields plus `delivery: "queue"` and an optional `coalescingKey: string`.                              |
| `Notification`  | The union of the three.                                                                                                                   |

The common fields on every member are `id` (a non-empty string, and the caller's
idempotency key), `targetLineageId` (a non-empty string), `provenance`, and
`payload` (any JSON value).

Provenance travels with the notification because the run that receives one is
not the run that wrote it. An operator steer, a parent run's event, and a webhook
all arrive on the same queue, and only these fields say which is which after the
fact.

### Functions

| Export           | Signature                                            | Returns                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `admissionClass` | `(notification: Notification) => "steer" \| "queue"` | How the notification is allowed to reach the model. Steers are promoted in a batch at turn close; queued notifications one at a time at idle.    |
| `coalesceKey`    | `(notification: Notification) => string \| null`     | The key the notification coalesces on, or `null` when it must never coalesce. Only a `system-event` that declares a `coalescingKey` returns one. |

## NotificationState

The pure bounded queue: the same rules with no I/O and no journal. Import from
`@smthrs/notifications/NotificationState`.

### Models

| Export              | Shape                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultCapacity`   | `128`. The default maximum pending notifications per run.                                                |
| `Pending`           | `{ notification: Notification; seq: number }`. `seq` is the journal sequence the admission committed at. |
| `State`             | `{ capacity: number; items: ReadonlyArray<Pending> }`. Frozen, and every transition returns a new value. |
| `Admission`         | `{ state: State; decision: AdmissionDecision }`.                                                         |
| `Promotion`         | `{ state: State; promoted: ReadonlyArray<Pending> }`.                                                    |
| `AdmissionDecision` | Re-exported from `NotificationEvent`, which owns the single declaration.                                 |

### Operations

| Export           | Signature                                                                                           | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `empty`          | `(capacity: number) => State`                                                                       | An empty queue. A capacity that is not a finite number becomes zero, so a misconfigured bound refuses everything rather than retaining an unbounded backlog.                                   |
| `admit`          | `(state: State, notification: Notification, seq: number) => Admission`                              | Admits, coalescing only pending system events with the same key, and keeping the first sequence so replay order stays stable. A queue at capacity decides `rejected-full` and retains nothing. |
| `applyAdmission` | `(state: State, notification: Notification, seq: number, decision: AdmissionDecision) => State`     | Applies a decision already committed in a journal record. Replay never re-decides.                                                                                                             |
| `pending`        | `(state: State, admission: "steer" \| "queue", targetLineageId?: string) => ReadonlyArray<Pending>` | Still-pending notifications of one admission class, in durable journal order, for one lineage or for every lineage.                                                                            |
| `promoteSteers`  | `(state: State, cutoffSeq: number, targetLineageId?: string) => Promotion`                          | Promotes every steer admitted at or before the cutoff. Notifications admitted after it remain pending.                                                                                         |
| `promoteQueued`  | `(state: State, targetLineageId?: string) => Promotion`                                             | Promotes exactly the oldest pending queued notification, or nothing.                                                                                                                           |
| `applyPromoted`  | `(state: State, ids: ReadonlyArray<string>) => State`                                               | Removes the ids a durable promotion record names, while replaying history.                                                                                                                     |

## NotificationEvent

The journal event types this package owns. Import from
`@smthrs/notifications/NotificationEvent`.

| Export              | Value or shape                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AdmittedEventType` | `"flows/notifications/Admitted"`. Frozen: the value is already durable in every journal this package has written to. |
| `PromotedEventType` | `"flows/notifications/Promoted"`. Frozen for the same reason.                                                        |
| `AdmissionDecision` | `"admitted" \| "coalesced" \| "rejected-full"`. The one declaration of the admission vocabulary.                     |
| `Admitted`          | `{ notification: Notification; decision: AdmissionDecision }`.                                                       |
| `Promoted`          | `{ boundary: string; targetLineageId: string; ids: ReadonlyArray<string> }`.                                         |
| `Event`             | `Admitted \| Promoted`.                                                                                              |

A `rejected-full` decision is never written. The queue refuses a full queue in
the receipt alone, so the notification id stays admissible once a boundary
drains. The literal remains in `AdmissionDecision` because a reader must stay
total over a record any writer could have produced.

| Export       | Signature                                             | Returns                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `isAdmitted` | `(event: Event) => event is Admitted`                 | Whether the owned event is an admission record.                                                                                                              |
| `isPromoted` | `(event: Event) => event is Promoted`                 | Whether the owned event is a promotion record.                                                                                                               |
| `fromEntry`  | `(entry: JournalEvent.Entry) => Option.Option<Event>` | The owned event a journal entry carries. Foreign entries and structurally invalid payloads answer `None`, so a projection over a shared journal stays total. |

## Projection

Import from `@smthrs/notifications/Projection`.

| Export   | Signature                                     | What it does                                                                                                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `derive` | `Journal.Projection<NotificationState.State>` | Re-derives pending notifications from admitted and promoted journal entries. Foreign entries leave the state unchanged. |

The projection starts at `NotificationState.empty(NotificationState.defaultCapacity)`,
which is what `NotificationQueue.layer` enforces. A deployment that raised the
bound with `NotificationQueue.layerWith` derives its own projection from
`NotificationState`, because this one would report a shorter queue than the run
actually holds.

## SteerPayload

The steering vocabulary carried inside a notification payload. Import from
`@smthrs/notifications/SteerPayload`.

The vocabulary lives here rather than in either package that uses it: a control
plane admits a steer and a harness drains it, and neither may depend on the
other, so the shape they have to agree on belongs beneath both.

| `Thinking`        | `"none" \| "minimal" \| "low" \| "medium" \| "high" \| "xhigh"`. Mirrors `ModelRequest.ReasoningEffort` in [`@smthrs/model`](https://model.smithers.sh/reference/api/), which this package deliberately does not depend on. |
| `MessagePayload`  | `{ kind: "Message"; body: string }`. The body may be empty.                                                                                                                                   |

## Alerts

Run conditions that have lasted too long, turned into durable, coalesced,
delivered-once notifications. Import from `@smthrs/notifications/Alerts`.

### Policy

| `Detector`         | `{ field: string; value: string; eventTypes?: ReadonlyArray<string> }`. `field` names a payload key, `value` the value that means the condition holds, and `eventTypes` narrows which entries are consulted. |
| `Rule`             | `{ afterMs: number; severity?: Severity; owner?: string; runbook?: string }`. `afterMs` is a whole, non-negative number of milliseconds.                                                                     |

| `defaultDetectors` | `Readonly<Record<string, Detector>>`: `waiting-approval` and `failed` on `status`, `stalled` on `health`, `quota-parked` on `waitingReason`.                                                                 |

An entry that carries a detector's field with the matching value opens the
condition; an entry that carries it with any other value closes it. A policy's
own `detectors` are merged over `defaultDetectors`.

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Open`  | `{ runId: string; condition: string; since: number }`. `since` is the journal time of the entry that opened the condition.                                         |
| `Alert` | `{ runId; condition; since; firedAt; severity; coalescingKey; owner?; runbook? }`. `firedAt` is `since + afterMs`, never the wall clock of whichever tick noticed. |

| `coalescingKey` | `(runId: string, condition: string) => string`                                                       | The key an alert coalesces on: one open condition on one run. Each component is percent-encoded, so neither can forge another pair's key.                             |
| `alertId`       | `(alert: Pick<Alert, "coalescingKey" \| "since">) => string`                                         | `alert:<coalescingKey>:<since>`. The identity a delivery is recorded under, stable for the life of one condition. A condition that clears and re-opens gets a new id. |

`AlertError` deliberately holds no request. A webhook request carries the
credential the deployment handed `layerWebhook`, and an error is logged, encoded,
and journaled in places a credential must never reach.

| `refused`       | The notification queue was at capacity. The sink was not called, and they are retried on the next tick. |
| `suppressed`    | Already delivered, and not delivered again.                                                             |

| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `layer` | `(policy: Policy) => Layer<AlertRuntime, never, Journal.Journal \| NotificationQueue \| Sink>` | The alert runtime over one policy. The policy is decoded when the layer is built, so a rule with an impossible delay fails the composition by name. |

| Export               | Value                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deliveredEventType` | `"flows.alerts.delivered"`. One entry per delivered alert.                         |
| `failedEventType`    | `"flows.alerts.failed"`. One entry per alert per failure code, never one per tick. |

A tick admits the alert, sends it, then journals the delivery. Admission is
idempotent and the send is not, so a crash between the first two costs a
duplicate admission the queue drops, while a crash between an accepted send and
the delivery record costs a duplicate page. That is why `deliver` is required to
deduplicate on `alertId`.

Both owned event types are excluded from condition detection: they are written
into the journal the detectors read, and they carry the alert's own vocabulary,
so reading them as evidence would let a page close the condition it paged about.

See [`@smthrs/control`](https://control.smithers.sh/reference/api/) for the run conditions the entries come
from.
