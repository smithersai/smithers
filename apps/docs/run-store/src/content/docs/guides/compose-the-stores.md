Both stores require a `SqlClient` and a `DurableWriter`, and both require their
tables to exist. This guide builds that composition from the bottom up.

## Check whether you need to build it

If you are running the Smithers engine, the composition already exists and
building a second one over the same database is a way to get two engines
fighting over one set of rows. [`@smthrs/engine-store`](https://engine-store.smithers.sh/reference/api/)
composes these stores with the journal, the step cache, and the durable engine
state, and `@smthrs/flows/NodeRuntime` builds that ladder over one SQLite file.
Reach for the layers here when you are writing a host, an adapter, or a sweeper
that has to agree with the engine about ownership.

## The layer order

Migrations must finish before either store is exposed, and both stores need the
writer and the client:

```ts
import * as DurableWriter from "@smthrs/database/DurableWriter"
import * as NodeDatabase from "@smthrs/database/node/NodeDatabase"
import { AttemptStore, Migrations, RunStore } from "@smthrs/run-store"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

export const storage = (filename: string) =>
  Layer.mergeAll(RunStore.layer, AttemptStore.layer).pipe(
    Layer.provideMerge(Migrations.layer),
    Layer.provideMerge(DurableWriter.layer()),
    Layer.provideMerge(NodeDatabase.layer({ filename }))
  )
```

`Layer.provideMerge` is what keeps the database and the writer in the output
context, so the rest of the host can reach them too.

The `SqlClient` must execute this package's SQLite migration and statement
dialect, including triggers, `randomblob`, `typeof`, and `json_valid`. The
composition must also satisfy the `DurableWriter` serialization contract:
concurrent write transactions cannot both commit from snapshots that exclude
each other's writes. The supported driver is
`@smthrs/database/node/NodeDatabase`, backed by `@effect/sql-sqlite-node` and
`node:sqlite`. Other databases require a dialect-specific migration and
statement implementation, which does not exist yet. Providing an arbitrary
Effect `SqlClient`, such as PostgreSQL, does not translate this package's SQL.

Store writes nested inside `DurableWriter.write` join it as savepoints. A
transient database conflict retries the entire outer transaction. Persistence
errors retain a payload-free `DatabaseError` in their cause chain so redaction
does not remove that retry classification. SQL text and bound values are not
included.

## Compose the migration set, do not run it twice

`Migrations.layer` installs this package's tables and nothing else. A host that
also runs the journal, the step cache, or the engine state should compose the
migration sets instead, so one migrator applies them in one pass:

```ts
import * as DatabaseMigrations from "@smthrs/database/Migrations"
import { Migrations } from "@smthrs/run-store"

const runAll = DatabaseMigrations.run([Migrations.set /* , the other packages' sets */])
```

`Migrations.set` reserves id block 1000, so its ids can never collide with
another package's. `@smthrs/engine-store` already composes the full set list.

## Choose the attempt-store policy

`AttemptStore.layer` takes the defaults: only `running` counts as in progress,
checkpoints cap at 1 MiB, and `put` is first-writer-wins. `layerWith` takes a
policy instead:

```ts
import { AttemptStore } from "@smthrs/run-store"

const attempts = AttemptStore.layerWith({
  inProgressStates: ["running", "retrying"],
  maxCheckpointBytes: 4 * 1024 * 1024,
  putMode: "upsert"
})
```

- `inProgressStates` names the states that mean "this attempt is still moving".
  `heartbeat` and `finish` fence on membership, and `finish` refuses them as
  targets. The names must be unique, non-empty durable text.
- `maxCheckpointBytes` must be between 1 and `AttemptStore.maximumCheckpointBytes`.
- `putMode: "upsert"` lets a re-`put` overwrite an attempt that is still in
  progress and report `Upserted`. A terminal attempt stays immutable in both
  modes.

All three are validated, detached, and frozen when the store is built, so an
invalid policy fails at composition time with `AttemptStoreError`.

## Stubs for compositions that must not persist

Both services ship an explicit absence, so a composition that cannot reach a
database still type-checks and still says so out loud:

| Layer                      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RunStore.layerNoop()`     | `create` and `get` fail with `persistence_failed`. Every compare-and-swap reports its "you lost" outcome: `NotFound`, or `ClaimLost` for `activate` and `abandonClaim`. |
| `AttemptStore.layerNoop()` | Every operation fails with the `unknown` code.                                                                                                                          |

Both take partial overrides, which is how a test replaces one operation without
building a whole store:

```ts
import { RunStore } from "@smthrs/run-store"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const alwaysFenced = RunStore.layerNoop({
  heartbeat: () => Effect.succeed({ _tag: "FenceLost" })
})
```

## Verify the composition

Read a run back through the layer you built. If migrations did not run, `get`
fails with `persistence_failed` rather than returning nothing:

```ts
import { RunStore } from "@smthrs/run-store"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const check = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const runs = yield* RunStore.RunStore
  yield* runs.create("composition-check", "{}")
  return yield* runs.get("composition-check")
})
```

## Next steps

  composed services.
- [Test against the real stores](/guides/testing/): the in-memory layer that skips
  all of this.
