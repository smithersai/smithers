## Get the package

`@smthrs/platform-node` is not on npm at 1.0.0-rc.0. It ships as a member of
the [smithers repository](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers) workspace, so
using it today means working from a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smithersai/smithers.git
cd smithers
pnpm install
```

Code that consumes it lives in that workspace too, either an existing package
or one you add, and depends on it with a workspace specifier:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@smthrs/platform-node": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

## Peers

`@effect/platform-node` and `effect` are peer
dependencies, so your project pins their versions rather than inheriting a
second copy. `@smthrs/platform-node` declares `4.0.0-rc.112` for both:

```bash
pnpm add @effect/platform-node@4.0.0-rc.112 effect@4.0.0-rc.112
```

The Effect Node adapter owns its `@effect/platform-node-shared` implementation
dependency; consumers do not need to declare that package separately.

Its own runtime dependencies, [`@smthrs/jj`](https://jj.smithers.sh/reference/api/) and
[`@smthrs/kernel`](https://kernel.smithers.sh/reference/api/), resolve from the same workspace.

The package ships ESM, CommonJS, and TypeScript declarations.

## Host requirements

| Requirement                                        | Why it is needed                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js 22.19.0 or later                           | the minimum this package's `engines` field declares                                                       |
| a POSIX host                                       | Windows has none of the primitives below and is unsupported                                               |
| CPython 3 at `/usr/bin/python3`                    | `AtomicFileSystem` runs every filesystem syscall through it                                               |
| that interpreter's `os` module supporting `dir_fd` | with `O_NOFOLLOW` and `O_DIRECTORY`, for `open`, `mkdir`, `readlink`, `rename`, `rmdir`, `stat`, `unlink` |
| `jj` 0.39.0 or newer on `PATH`                     | required at construction by every complete `NodeHost` layer                                               |

### jj is checked at construction

Every complete host bundle, `NodeHost.layer`, `NodeHost.layerAt`,
`NodeHost.layerContained`, and `NodeHost.layerContainedAt`, builds a
version-checked `Jj` layer before providing its services. This requires jj
0.39.0 or newer even when the program requests only the filesystem or process
spawner. Check the installed version with `jj --version`.

If the executable is missing, bundle construction fails with a typed `JjError`
whose code is `not_installed`. An older version fails with
`unsupported_version`. The version probe runs outside the host process ledger;
repository commands use the selected process runner.

### The interpreter fails late, on purpose

`NodeHost.layer` builds cleanly on a host with no CPython 3. The executable is
re-validated on every request rather than once at construction, because the
file a path names can be replaced while a host runs, and a check that happened
only at boot would be a check about a file that is no longer there.

The consequence is that on `node:22-slim`, `node:22-alpine`, or a distroless
image the layer builds, the run starts, and the first guarded filesystem call
inside a flow body fails with `PermissionDenied`. Install `python3`, or point
the adapter at the interpreter you do have:

```ts
import * as AtomicFileSystem from "@smthrs/platform-node/AtomicFileSystem"

const filesystem = AtomicFileSystem.layerWith({ executable: "/usr/local/bin/python3" })
```

For the rest of what `layerWith` configures, see
[Configure the filesystem helper](/guides/configure-the-filesystem-helper/).

## Individual services without jj

Applications that do not need `Jj` can provide individual service layers.
This composition supplies the bundle's filesystem, path, process spawner, and
HTTP client without constructing a `Jj` layer:

```ts
import { NodeHost } from "@smthrs/platform-node"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"
import * as Path from "effect/Path"

const platform = Layer.mergeAll(NodeHost.AtomicFileSystem.layer, Path.layer)
const spawner = NodeHost.NodeChildProcessSpawner.layer.pipe(Layer.provide(platform))
const hostWithoutJj = Layer.mergeAll(platform, spawner, NodeHost.NodeHttpClient.layerUndici)
```

Provide `hostWithoutJj` to a program that needs these services, or provide only
the individual layer it needs. The spawner requires both filesystem and path
services, supplied by `platform` above. The filesystem still requires the
CPython interpreter described above. This composition does not provide `Jj`
and cannot satisfy consumers that require the complete five-tag host.

## Import forms

The root entry point re-exports three modules as namespaces:

```ts
import { HostLiveness, NodeHost, ProcessReaper, ScopedProcess } from "@smthrs/platform-node"
```

Each module is also importable from its own subpath, which is the form the
[API reference](/reference/api/) uses:

```ts
import * as HostLiveness from "@smthrs/platform-node/HostLiveness"
import * as NodeHost from "@smthrs/platform-node/NodeHost"
import * as ProcessReaper from "@smthrs/platform-node/ProcessReaper"
```

`AtomicFileSystem` is deliberately not in the barrel. Reach it through its own
subpath, or as a re-export off `NodeHost`:

```ts
import * as AtomicFileSystem from "@smthrs/platform-node/AtomicFileSystem"
// or
import { NodeHost } from "@smthrs/platform-node"
const filesystem = NodeHost.AtomicFileSystem.layer
```

Two subpath shapes are blocked in the export map:
`@smthrs/platform-node/internal/*` and `@smthrs/platform-node/*/index`.
`@smthrs/platform-node/package.json` is exported.

## Entry points

| Import                                   | Source                                                                                                                                    |

Every entry point is Node-only by construction: the bundle resolves
`node:child_process` and its siblings, and a build check keeps it that way. For a
browser host, use [`@smthrs/platform-browser`](https://platform-browser.smithers.sh/reference/api/); for Bun,
[`@smthrs/platform-bun`](https://platform-bun.smithers.sh/reference/api/).

## What a real composition adds

This package provides raw host services. A composition that enforces
capabilities wraps them in [`@smthrs/kernel`](https://kernel.smithers.sh/reference/api/)'s decorators, which
need a workspace root and a grant store. Add that package to your own
dependencies with the same workspace specifier, then compose:

```ts
import * as GrantStore from "@smthrs/kernel/GrantStore"
import * as HostServices from "@smthrs/kernel/HostServices"
import * as Workspace from "@smthrs/kernel/Workspace"
import { NodeHost } from "@smthrs/platform-node"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

const guarded = HostServices.layer.pipe(
  Layer.provide(NodeHost.layer),
  Layer.provide(Workspace.layer("/absolute/workspace")),
  Layer.provide(GrantStore.layerNoop)
)
```

`GrantStore.layerNoop` allows every operation inside the workspace. It is a
seam for tests and boot paths, not a production policy. Replace it with a
rule-based store before running untrusted work; see
[Write a capability policy](https://kernel.smithers.sh/guides/write-a-capability-policy/).

Turning on process containment adds a `ProcessLedger`, which the journal backs.
See [Contain child processes](/guides/contain-child-processes/).

Most programs never compose this by hand. `@smthrs/flows`' `NodeRuntime` builds
the whole durable runtime, including `NodeHost.layerContainedAt` and
`HostLiveness.isAlive`, from one options object.
