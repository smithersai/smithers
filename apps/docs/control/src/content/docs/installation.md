## Install the package

```bash
pnpm add @smthrs/control@next
```

The `next` tag is where the 1.0 release candidates publish.

The package requires Node.js 26.4.0 or later and ships as both ESM and
CommonJS with TypeScript declarations. Its runtime dependencies install with
it: [`effect`](https://effect.website) and the `@smthrs/*` packages the plane
composes.

The package imports no `node:*` module. Identity comes from
`globalThis.crypto`, encryption comes from Web Crypto, and persistence speaks
the driver-neutral SQL contract, so the same modules run in Node.js and in a
browser that supplies a SQL driver. That is a statement about the imports, not
a tested guarantee: nothing here is exercised in a browser, so verify your own
bundle before you depend on it.

## Import forms

The root entry point re-exports every module as a namespace:

```ts
import { Control, ControlLive, Monitor, SqlControlRuntime } from "@smthrs/control"
```

Each module is also importable from its own subpath, which is the form the
[API reference](/reference/api/) uses:

```ts
import * as ControlExecutor from "@smthrs/control/ControlExecutor"
import * as ControlSchema from "@smthrs/control/ControlSchema"
```

The deterministic test stack has its own subpath:

```ts
import * as TestControl from "@smthrs/control/test/TestControl"
```

Two subpath families are not public and are blocked in the export map:
`@smthrs/control/internal/*` and `@smthrs/control/migrations/*`, along with
every nested `*/index`. `@smthrs/control/package.json` is exported.

## What a composition adds

`ControlLive.layer` requires four collaborators, and a host provides all four:

| Requirement         | Package                                       | What it does here                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ControlRuntime`    | this package                                  | Stores plans, tokens, grants, idempotency records, and run rows.                   |
| `Journal`           | [`@smthrs/journal`](https://journal.smithers.sh/reference/api/)             | Records every decision beside the state change it caused, and backs `watch`.       |
| `NotificationQueue` | [`@smthrs/notifications`](https://notifications.smithers.sh/reference/api/) | Carries a steer to the turn boundary that delivers it, and counts what is pending. |
| `Registry`          | [`@smthrs/registry`](https://registry.smithers.sh/reference/api/)           | Answers `list({ _tag: "flows" })` with the flows this host discovered.             |

`ControlExecutor` is optional. A composition that provides none observes and
records but starts nothing, which is the correct shape for a monitor or a
read-only dashboard.

### An in-memory composition

`TestControl.layer` bundles all four collaborators with the deterministic
runtime. Its journal uses a real in-memory SQLite database, so the
[Quickstart](/quickstart/) adds the optional Node driver:

```bash
pnpm add effect@4.0.0-rc.115 @effect/sql-sqlite-node@4.0.0-rc.115
```

### A durable composition

```bash
pnpm add @smthrs/database@next @smthrs/run-store@next effect@4.0.0-rc.115 @effect/sql-sqlite-node@4.0.0-rc.115
```

- [`@smthrs/database`](https://database.smithers.sh/reference/api/) supplies the SQL client and the
  `DurableWriter` every control write serializes through.
- [`@smthrs/run-store`](https://run-store.smithers.sh/reference/api/) supplies the fenced run store
  `SqlControlRuntime` maps the control lifecycle onto.

See [Store control state in a database](/guides/durable-storage/) for the
layer stack and the migration order.

### A remote composition

The RPC boundary uses Effect's own HTTP, WebSocket, and RPC modules, which ship
inside `effect`. A Node host adds the platform bindings and a serialization
format:

```bash
pnpm add @effect/platform-node@4.0.0-rc.115 @effect/platform-node-shared@4.0.0-rc.115
```

See [Serve the control plane over RPC](/guides/serve-over-rpc/).

### Credential storage

The credential boundary needs a store and a cipher. `CredentialStore.layerMemory`
and `WebCryptoCipher.layer` need nothing beyond this package;
`SqlCredentialStore.layer` needs the same database packages a durable
composition adds. See [Store and resolve a credential](/guides/store-credentials/).

## Next step

Run one plan through approval and launch in the [Quickstart](/quickstart/).
