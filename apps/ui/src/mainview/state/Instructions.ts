 * Wave 13 §F — honesty is CATALOG-GROUNDED, not prompt-fragile.
 *
 * The live model stopped faking actions in wave 12 but kept OFFERING
 * capabilities that do not exist ("a workflow that drafts and emails your
 * team" — there is no email connector). Prompt lines saying "don't lie" did
 * not hold, because the model had no ground truth about what it can do and
 * rounded every ask up to an offer.
 *
 * So the capability section of the system prompt is GENERATED on every turn
 * from the one source of truth — the live command catalog the "commands"
 * tool exposes plus the connector state the state projection already carries
 * — and it states the rule plainly: capabilities are exactly these; anything
 * else gets "can't yet" plus the one honest real next step; and offering a
 * workflow never launders an impossible effect, because a run can only call
 * the same catalog.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the store, the DOM, or the network, so the section is
 * unit-pinned against the five §F asks.

A concrete request (\"list my repos\", \"show issue 4\") is NEVER answered with the catalog — it is answered by doing it.",
