/*
 * The anonymous turn ceiling (apps/server turnLimit.ts; factory mock 22). A
 * signed-out visitor whose turn the Worker refused with 429 turn_rate_limited
 * gets the refusal as its own card carrying the server's sentence and reset
 * time, with no generic failure bubble, and the composer settles to idle. The
 * branch is the refusal's code plus the session, never the sentence: both
 * server wordings take the card, a signed-in login's ceiling keeps the failure
 * line, a session the app has not confirmed signed out (identity still
 * loading, or the seam unavailable) keeps the failure line, and every other
 * failure keeps today's message.
