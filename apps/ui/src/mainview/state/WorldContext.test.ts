 * workspace is zarquon-mimsy-7741", the edit persisted, and the model then
 * answered that it could not retrieve the codeword and reached for a
 * repository file read instead. The value genuinely was not in its context —
 * the per-turn runtime context carried world documents by path, title and
 * confidence, never by body.
