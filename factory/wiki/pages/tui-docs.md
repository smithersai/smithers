# Executable terminal documentation

`apps/tui-docs` is a dedicated Astro site for the terminal interface. Pages are authored in `apps/tui/docs/`, and their examples run the production TUI to produce recordings. The owning guide is `apps/tui-docs/README.md`.

## Executable Markdown

A `tui-script` fence names a reviewed scenario and drives the production TUI in a private PTY. Model responses are deterministic fixtures, while cells, file changes, session writes, controls and checks execute for real. `Wait for answer` requires a saved successful answer; visible source text cannot satisfy it. A `browser-script` fence drives the real playground in Chromium with provider responses controlled at the HTTP boundary.

These recordings do not measure live model quality. The recorder captures terminal frames and encodes GIFs with FFmpeg; a failed example fails the build.

## Build graph

`//apps/tui-docs:build` depends on `:recordings`. Both are cached `ToolBuild` targets: recordings run `pnpm run record` into `public/recordings`, and the site runs `astro build` into `dist`. The package also declares `check`, `test` and `browserTests` targets. The recorder verifies cached artifact hashes and publishes a receipt only after assertions and encoding succeed.

Recording needs the pinned Node, Bun 1.4 or later, Python 3, Git, FFmpeg, Chromium and the native workspace helper for flow examples. `CHROME_BIN`, `FFMPEG`, `SMITHERS_DOCS_BUN` and `SMITHERS_WORKSPACE_JJ_EXPORT_BINARY` select installed tools.

## Browser playground

The playground runs `Agent.Agent` on `Flow.make` in the production QuickJS cell sandbox. Its only capabilities are `ls`, `read`, `write` and `check` over a bounded virtual volume. Each completed model response is persisted before its cell executes, and recovery replays committed responses and call results without executing completed operations again. Web Locks allow one writer across tabs. Storage is capped at 4 MB and files at 16 × 8 KB.

## Provider access

Settings accept a base URL, model and API key; the key stays in tab memory and is sent only to that provider. `pnpm --filter @smithers/tui-docs start` serves the portable Node server, which offers sponsored access when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set server-side. It picks the cheapest text model with at least 32K context, caps output at 2,048 tokens, and defaults to $0.50 and 100 calls per UTC day plus 16 calls per visitor cookie.

## Test boundary

The `test` script runs the Node unit tests, and `test:browser` runs the browser suite against a controlled HTTP provider. They are offline correctness tests, not evidence of a live model's quality or a hosted deployment. The Cloud `docs` gate runs the typecheck and unit tests; `:browserTests` needs a runner with the recording toolchain.
