/**
 * `organization/delegate`: a principal hands a task to a specialist it
 * hired, and reviews the output before it counts.
 *
 * The specialist must be active and hired by the parent (directly or below
 * it); it works under its own host, seat, grants, memory, and budget, and its
 * result is checked against its own charter. The parent then reviews the
 * result (`verdict`: `accept` or `revise`); a revision goes back to the
 * specialist with the parent's findings, for at most two rounds. An accepted
 * output is written to the wiki under the organization's generated directory
 * with the parent's review (by the specialist when it holds `wiki-write`,
 * else published by the parent when it does), and the run's receipt records
 * the outcome and the document.
