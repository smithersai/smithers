/**
 * An organization host whose seats answer from a script instead of a model,
 * for the offline end-to-end test (`flows/test/organization-host.test.mjs`).
 *
 * Everything else is the production host: the same settings, the durable
 * engine, the gateway, real microVM workspaces. Each seat recognises the
 * principal it is serving by the `# Role: <name> (<id>)` line of its system
 * prompt, looks up that principal's part, fills every output field its
 * charter declares, and answers with one cell: the router hands the request
 * to the contract writer, the contract writer names the builder and the
 * checker, the builder adds a line to `README.md` with the `edit` tool in
 * its workspace machine (a compensable step, as a model's edit is), and the
 * checker approves.
 *
 * The parts are the public example roster's (`assistant` routes to `lead`,
 * which contracts `builder` and `checker`) unless
 * `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_ROLES` names others, as JSON from principal
 * id to `route:<to>`, `contract:<builder>,<checker>`, `build`, `check`, or
 * `document` (the role answers the request itself, with no handoff),
 * `ask-hire` (it asks the host for a hire with a first task), or `ask-meeting`
 * (it asks for thirty minutes with the owner), so
 * the same script drives any roster.
 *
 * With `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_HOLD=<file>` set and that file
 * present, the builder takes two turns: the first appends to `README.md`
 * with `bash` and does not answer, and the second writes `<file>.held` and never settles, so a
 * test can stop the host in the middle of the builder's turn, after its edit.
 * Without the file the second turn answers.
 *
 * With `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_REFUSE=1` every model call fails the
 * way a provider refuses an account with no credits.
 *
 * `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_OMIT`, as JSON from principal id to
 * `{ field, asks }`, makes that principal leave `field` out of its first
 * `asks` answers to a task (1: only the first ask; 2: the correction too),
 * the way a model forgets a charter field.
 *
 * With `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_READ=<wiki path>` every role but a
 * builder first reads that page with `wiki-read` in a cell of its own, with
 * no `try`, and answers in the next cell; `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_RECALL=<query>`
 * does the same with a `recall` of its memory.
 *
 * With `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_CHECK_SHOWS=1` the checker reads the
 * last line of `README.md` in its workspace and puts what it saw in its
 * summary.
 *
 * With `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_CHECK_PROBES=1` the checker's first
 * reply probes `README.md` with `bash` and answers "blocked: output not
 * observed" in the same reply, as real seats do; its next turn approves with
 * `Read after the refusal: <line>` only if the probe's output reached it.
 *
 * `SMITHERS_ORGANIZATION_SCRIPTED_EXTRA`, the same shape, makes a principal
 * the script does not serve decline with an undeclared field on its first
 * `asks` answers.
 *
 * `node flows/organization/testing/scripted-host.ts serve --standalone ...`
 * takes `serve`'s flags.
