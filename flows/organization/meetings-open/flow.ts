/**
 * `organization/meetings-open`: opens a role's one-on-one at its slot.
 *
 * When the owner's Slack app is configured, the role's agenda (from its
 * private note) is posted in the owner's direct messages with the app, under
 * the role's name, and the thread is recorded: the owner's replies in it are
 * answered by the role (`organization/meetings-reply`) and become the
 * meeting's notes. Without Slack the run records `not connected` and the
 * note's Notes section is the meeting's only channel. The schedule starts it
 * at the slot's start; `at` names another instant inside the slot.
