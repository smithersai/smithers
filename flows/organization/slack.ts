/**
 * The host's one Slack app: owner messages become `organization/intake`
 * runs, and approval gates parked under a Slack request are asked in its
 * thread with buttons.
 *
 * Admission is the source's, fail-closed: only the configured workspace,
 * and only the owners' direct messages or mentions in a listed channel;
 * echoes of this app are dropped. Each event is submitted under its
 * `slack:<team>:<event>` key, so Slack's redelivery joins the run it already
 * started. A press is answered only for the prompt it belongs to and only
 * from an owner (`Approval.decision`); anything else leaves the gate
 * pending. Which run a thread belongs to and which prompt a button belongs
 * to are kept in `slack.json` in the state directory, so both survive a
 * restart. An owner's message in a thread a one-on-one was opened in
 * (`meetings.ts` records them in `meetings.json`) starts
 * `organization/meetings-reply` for that meeting's role instead of a
 * delivery.
