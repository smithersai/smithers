/**
 * `organization/meetings-prepare`: a role prepares its next one-on-one.
 *
 * The role answers a preparation task under its own host: its agenda from
 * its receipts since the last week, its blockers, its open tasks from earlier
 * one-on-ones, and the decisions it needs. The agenda is written to its
 * private note (`<generatedDir>/meetings/<role>/<date>.md`), keeping any notes
 * already there. The schedule starts it the day before the slot; `at` finds
 * the next slot after another instant.
