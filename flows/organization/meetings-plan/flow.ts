/**
 * `organization/meetings-plan`: plans the weekly one-on-ones from the
 * meetings page.
 *
 * The page's series (weekday, slot length, role order, the owner's time zone,
 * first start, and first date) becomes one contiguous block of back-to-back
 * slots; each slot's weekly event is written to the connected calendar, or
 * the step reports `not connected`; each role's prepare, open, and follow-up
 * triggers are registered on the host's scheduler in the series' zone; and
 * the plan is written to `<generatedDir>/meetings/plan.md`. While an owner
 * input is unset nothing is planned and the run says which. The host runs it
 * daily, so an edit to the page takes effect the next day, or at once when
 * started by hand.
