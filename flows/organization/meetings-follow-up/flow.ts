/**
 * `organization/meetings-follow-up`: turns a role's one-on-one into tasks.
 *
 * The meeting's notes are the owner's and the role's messages in its Slack
 * thread and whatever the owner wrote in the note's Notes section. With none,
 * the slot is recorded as not held and no model is asked. Otherwise the role
 * turns them into tasks (`{ title, owner, due }`), written to the note's Tasks
 * section and to its open task list
 * (`<generatedDir>/meetings/<role>/tasks.md`), which its next preparation
 * reads. The schedule starts it just after the slot; `at` names another
 * instant after it.
