/**
 * Owner notifications without Slack: a host whose Slack app is not
 * configured tells the owner on this Mac when a run parks at a gate or
 * fails, as a macOS notification. On by default; `SMITHERS_ORG_NOTIFY=off`
 * turns it off. With Slack configured the owner is reached there instead.
 *
 * Each gate and each failed run is announced once, across restarts: what was
 * announced is kept in `<state>/notified.json`. A host starting on a state
 * directory it never announced from says nothing about runs that failed
 * before, and announces every gate still waiting.
