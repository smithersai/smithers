/**
 * `organization/hire`: a principal hires a specialist for a need, and
 * optionally hands it its first task.
 *
 * The parent answers a hiring task under its own host with the structured
 * `hire` field (`Hiring.HireSpec`, or null for no hire). The host validates
 * it against the hiring rules (`Hiring.propose`): the hire's grants are a
 * subset of the parent's and never personal accounts or owner contact; its
 * depth, the parent's children and persistent counts, and the parent's daily
 * token allocation stay within limits; the parent and everything above it are
 * active. A hire the rules refuse is asked again once with the rules it
 * broke, as a charter violation is. A valid hire is written to `<rosterDir>/Specialists/<id>.md` with
 * its own memory namespace and budget carved from the parent's, and the
 * roster is pinned with it. With `task`, the new hire's first task runs as an
 * `organization/delegate` child keyed `<key>.task`. The receipt
 * (`<generatedDir>/<key>/hire.json`) holds the request, the parent's answer
 * summary, the outcome, and every violation.
