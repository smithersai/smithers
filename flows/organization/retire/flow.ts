/**
 * `organization/retire`: retires a hired principal and everything it hired.
 *
 * Retirement is terminal: every grant is revoked, `retiredAt` is recorded,
 * and the memory namespace is kept so the principal's history stays
 * attributable. Each retired profile is rewritten in
 * `<rosterDir>/Specialists/` with compare-and-set, the roster is pinned with
 * them, and from then on every dispatch to one of them, or to anything they
 * hired, is refused. A core role is retired by editing its page, not here.
