/**
 * `organization/qualify`: one attempt at one qualification case.
 *
 * A case (`Org/Cases/<id>.md`) gives one principal a task and the context it
 * would retrieve. The attempt pins the roster, runs the principal's turn the
 * way a delivery does (composed under its own host and seat, checked against
 * its charter, asked again once when a result breaks it), in a workspace
 * machine of the case's repository when the case needs one, and writes
 * the answer, or the failure that stopped it, as a receipt under the
 * organization's generated directory. Scoring against the case's
 * expectations is the `qualify` command's (`qualify/cases.ts`); the flow only
 * records what the principal answered.
