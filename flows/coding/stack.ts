/**
 * A coding request that works on the repository's mythical stack.
 *
 * The stack service retains the stack tip into this workspace's source ref
 * and names it as the request's `base`. Before gathering, the request imports
 * that commit and starts a fresh working change on it, so the planner's
 * native history IS the stack: a plan can amend or insert anywhere in it, or
 * append. When the request is delivered, `coding/vibe` hands the cleaned
 * result back to the stack service instead of landing it (vibe-landing.ts).
