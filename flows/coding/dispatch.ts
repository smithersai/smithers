/**
 * One dispatched agent turn.
 *
 * Every other door in this package runs a *programme*: `coding/ImplementPlan`
 * implements a validated plan, `coding/Request` plans then implements with
 * required checks, `repository/Job` investigates an event. Each is registered
 * only when its owning configuration exists, and each answers with receipts
 * rather than with what the agent said. A cloud caller that wants exactly one
 * turn — a person typed a message, the agent should answer it and may edit the
 * workspace while doing so — had no door at all, which is the gap this module
 * closes.
 *
 * It is deliberately small, because the machinery already exists. The turn is
 * one {@link module:AgentAction}, which is one run of the 1.0 cell loop under
 * the host's registry, sandbox budget and capability envelope. The seat is
 * resolved through the same `SeatResolver` every other coding role uses, with
 * one difference this door needs: the role and the model are *per request*.
 * A dispatched turn is launched by a caller that already knows which seat the
 * person picked, and re-reading it from the host's launch environment would
 * make every turn in a workspace run as the same role.
 *
 * Progress is not published here. The turn runs as an ordinary flow execution,
 * so the control journal already carries its lifecycle and its agent frames,
 * and the gateway already folds those into the `transcript`, `run-events` and
 * `run-tree` projections that `packages/smithers/src/Serve.ts` mounts on
 * `/projections`. {@link DispatchResult.runId} is the handle: it is the
 * `runId` every one of those selectors takes. A caller streams a turn by
 * subscribing to that run, and the result is what it commits when the turn
 * ends.
