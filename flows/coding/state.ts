/** Where a configured coding host keeps its own mutable state.
 *
 * `serve --root <workspace>` is handed a live JJ working copy, and every
 * durable layer puts `.flows/control.db`, `.flows/engine.db` and their
 * `-wal`/`-shm` companions under the root it is given. JJ auto-tracks new
 * files, so each engine write changed the working-copy tree digest, `jj status`
 * reported `A .flows/control.db`, and `coding/PreparePlan` failed its own
 * freshness check three seconds after start with
 * `{"_tag":"coding/Error","code":"stale_revision","message":"Native code
 * changed during planning or clarification; gather and plan again"}`.
 *
 * Host state therefore resolves beside the working copy, never inside it. The
 * pre-fix in-root layout stays reachable for a single-repository local run, but
 * only when an operator names it.
