# Configuring the workspace coding host

This is private deployment configuration for `smithers-coding-host`, the separate
workspace executable. The ordinary Smithers CLI keeps its existing commands.
The host uses the same Effect composition and durable engine on Node and Bun.

The host loads `<root>/.smithers/coding-project.json` when it exists and
`SMITHERS_CODING_PROJECT` is unset. Set that variable to an explicit UTF-8 JSON
file to override the default. An absent default leaves the manual plan route
available; an empty, missing, malformed or invalid explicit file refuses
startup. An invalid default also refuses startup and names its path. The file
is read once before host construction through the injected Effect filesystem.
Restart the host to adopt a changed configuration or catalog.

Both the config filename and optional `wikiOutput` resolve relative to `--root`; absolute
paths are accepted. The output may point at the separate wiki repository. JSON
is limited to 256 KiB of actual streamed bytes. Unknown properties are refused,
including nested page/check properties. Wiki page IDs and check IDs must be
unique; related page IDs must be present. The existing wiki recipe still owns
source path admission, publication and semantic verification.

```json
{
  "wiki": false,
  "implementation": "coding/implementation",
  "checks": [{
    "id": "types",
    "target": "types",
    "flow": "checks/types",
    "tier": "fast",
    "required": true
  }],
  "historyLimit": 100,
  "maxMemoryBytes": 49152
}
```

Wiki is off by default. Source files, existing project documents and resolved
native JJ history provide planning context without generated artifacts. To
enable Wiki, add `"wiki": true`, an external `wikiOutput`, a `reviewer` identity,
and the non-empty `pages` inventory using the Wiki `PageSpec`. Supplied optional
metadata is still validated while the feature is off. This flag leaves native
history, source identity and validation invariants intact. An explicitly required
`checks/wiki` refuses while Wiki is off; update that operator policy deliberately.
Optional generated-Wiki checks are omitted while the feature is off.

The example names must identify real registered implementation/check flows in
that repository. This file does not define shell commands or accept claimed
flow digests; the existing catalog supplies verified execution identities.
`reviewer` identifies the semantic review policy, not a provider credential or
a claim that review already passed. Page entries use the existing wiki
`PageSpec`; check entries use the existing `Check` without `flowDigest`.
`historyLimit` is optional (1–100, default 100). `maxMemoryBytes` is optional
(1024–92160, default 49152). A project with no adequate required checks still
fails the existing planning/validation policy; the loader invents none.

## Seats

`seats` maps a role id to a seat alias (`sol`, `astra`, `luna`, `opus`,
`fable`, `qwen`) or an explicit `provider:model`, for example
`{"coding/implement": "luna", "coding/plan": "sol"}`. A declared role wins over
the `SMITHERS_CODING_*_MODEL` defaults; `SMITHERS_CODING_SEATS` (a JSON object of
the same shape) is the operator's override over both. The seat's provider picks
the credential the workspace binds: `openai:` the Codex connection or OpenAI
key, `anthropic:` the Anthropic key. `jev` is refused here: Jev answers
classifier questions through the host evaluator (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`), as in
the `coding/JevCheck` lint check, and never runs an agent turn.

```sh
SMITHERS_CODING_PROJECT=/etc/smithers/project.json \
SMITHERS_CODING_IMPLEMENT_MODEL=provider:implementation-model \
SMITHERS_CODING_PLAN_MODEL=provider:planning-model \
SMITHERS_CODING_POC_MODEL=provider:prototype-model \
SMITHERS_CODING_WIKI_MODEL=provider:review-model \
smithers-coding-host serve --root /home/developer/workspace
```

`SMITHERS_CODING_IMPLEMENT_MODEL` is required. The optional plan, POC and wiki
variables select the existing logical seats `coding/plan`, `coding/poc` and
`wiki/reviewer`. When omitted, the host explicitly uses the implementation model
for that role, unless the project's `seats` names it. Every selection must be a
seat alias or a `provider:model`; this configuration
does not add credentials or a broker. Existing workspace/user provider setup
supplies authentication. Deployment still supplies the owning
`SMITHERS_GATEWAY_ID`, gateway `SMITHERS_API_KEY`, and existing binding/single-host
lock. `PATH` remains the explicit environment for declared check executables.

The loader adds no public package API, service, database or gateway payload.
Its private `ProjectConfig` is the existing memory configuration plus the wiki
reviewer identity. Operator data is never accepted from model output or a
gateway request. Startup diagnostics identify the invalid contract without
printing the JSON contents.

This Smithers repository declares its own configuration in
`.smithers/coding-project.json`: the policy and runtime checks are required
fast gates; native Node/Bun and deployment bundle Node/Bun run as required slow
checks; lint is advisory; and the `pages` array is the one wiki page catalog, which the Cloud
refresh and `flows/wiki/main.ts` both read. The ordinary `checks/*`
declarations contain only target invocations, not copied test lists. The host
must provide `smithers-build`, the declared toolchain, native helpers and build
cache through its existing command environment. An immutable source export does
not borrow the editing checkout's node_modules. Cold toolchain/bootstrap cost
may make the blocking target slow; its label is policy, not a latency receipt.
The configuration carries no provider credentials or private Ops data.
