/*
 * L106: the registry a workspace really has, and what is in it.
 *
 * `/flow.create` launched `create-workflow` — a 0.x JSX name no 1.0
 * composition ever registered — and refused on every workspace. The half this
 * file guards is the other one: that the id the door now launches
 * (`FLOW_AUTHORING_ENTRY`, imported from the module the app imports, so this
 * cannot pass against a name only this test believes in) resolves in the
 * registry `flows/coding/host.ts` actually composes.
 *
 * That composition is `bindRepositoryRegistry(project, builtins, policy)` over
 * `provisionBuiltins`, and it is built here from the real functions against a
 * real temporary state root and a real empty repository — the shape of a
 * freshly imported repo, which is where this was measured broken. A mock
 * registry would pass whatever the host composed.
 *
 * It also pins the fact the app half depends on: the entry is a PROMPT body.
 * `AgentSession` returns early for every non-Prompt body before its trace and
 * pump, so a module entry would put a run card on screen with no agent frames
 * in it.
