 * R96 B1: taking the trial's own test request out of the candidate moves the
 * digest of every draft ever stored, and a registry row keeps the digest it was
 * registered with. Plue dispatches a job straight from that row —
 * `internal/services/repository_jobs_worker.go`, `"digest": reg.Digest,
 * "configuration": config.Input` — and never recomputes it, so a registration
 * enabled before this build either decodes here or stops running its jobs.
