/*
 * The repository host's catalog, after one of its own runs writes a flow.
 *
 * `flows/coding/host.ts` assembles its catalog itself: the repository's own
 * `flows/` tree with the ordinary verified loader, and the reserved job
 * declarations out of the measured bundle the host shipped as. That catalog
 * used to be frozen for the life of the process, so `create-flow` — which
 * this host serves — could write `flows/<id>/flow.ts` and leave a flow the
 * same host could neither plan nor run until it was restarted.
 *
 * The composition now serves it through `Executable.layerRefreshable`. This
 * file is about the two halves of that rule holding against the real
 * `repositoryCatalog` and the real `bindRepositoryRegistry`: a project flow
 * written after startup is rebuilt, and a reserved job declaration is not,
 * because its bytes are the bundle and not whatever is on disk.
