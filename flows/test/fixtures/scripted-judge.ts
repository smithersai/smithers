/**
 * The one judge a native test host runs, scripted from the evidence instead of
 * fetched from a gateway.
 *
 * These fixtures build a whole configured host — plan, cell, guarded writes,
 * checks, repository jobs — and every one of those readers asks Jev. A host
 * that binds `Evaluator.layerFromEnvironment(process.env)` on a machine with no
 * `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` gets `Evaluator.layerUnavailable()`, and then the
 * harness's completion brake, which never falls back, ends the run at its first
 * completion as `completion_unjudged`. That is the right behaviour for a
 * deployed host and the wrong dependency for a fixture: a test host should not
 * need a network service to decide whether its own scripted cell did what the
 * fixture told it to do.
 *
 * `81bca45092e9` fixed the same problem for the offline examples by binding
 * `Evaluator.layerScripted` where they used to bind
 * `Evaluator.layerFromEnvironment(process.env)`. This is that mechanism, at the
 * seam a host already has: `NativeControl.Platform.evaluator`, which
 * `flows/coding/host.ts` prefers over `evaluatorLayer(process.env)` for the
 * agent loop and for every repository reader, so a host never runs two judges.
 *
 * ## Scripted, not permissive
 *
 * A layer that answers "complete" to everything satisfies the compiler and
 * deletes the brake. Every answer here is computed from the state the
 * classifier sends, and `coding-host-native.test.ts` drives the brake's own
 * `CompletionClaim.read` with this judge over a claim it must refuse.
 * The completion brake's verdict rides on one question — does the claim report
 * a command or a result this run's record does not record — and
 * {@link reportsUnrecordedWork} answers that one by reading the claim against
 * `checksRun` and `lastCheck`, so a fixture whose cell starts inventing a test
 * run fails exactly as a live host would.
 *
 * ## One judge, many classifiers
 *
 * A composition holds one `Evaluator`, and the host's readers do not share a
 * question set. The script therefore dispatches on the question ids it was
 * handed, and answers **by id**: a scripted answer map missing an id the
 * classifier asked fails the whole evaluation as `invalid_answer`, which
 * reaches the brake as `completion_unjudged` and reads like a defect in
 * whatever the case was actually about. Question ids this fixture scripts no
 * answer for keep the keyless host's own reply, `unreachable`, so no assertion
 * anywhere starts passing because a fixture said yes.
