/** The coding host judges inside a default-deny microsandbox. Egress is an
 * HTTP proxy the guest environment names through `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`,
 * never a transparent one, and that proxy is what substitutes the platform
 * credential: the guest holds only the placeholder
 * `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and iron-proxy swaps the real value
 * into `authorization` on the way to `ai-gateway.vercel.sh`.
 *
 * `flows/coding/serve.ts:82-87` builds a proxy-aware client for exactly this
 * reason. This test asserts the judge production installs — the
 * `platform.evaluator ?? evaluatorLayer(process.env)` of
 * `flows/coding/host.ts:183` — reaches the gateway the same way. A judge that
 * dials the gateway directly is dropped by the firewall and every completion
 * comes back unjudged, so the evidence has to be that the proxy was asked to
 * open the tunnel, not merely that the call failed: a direct dial fails too. */
