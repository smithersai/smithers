/**
 * The one discovered flow under `flows/` that still delegates, and why.
 *
 * `coding/capture-wiki-check` refuses unless the descriptor being run is bound
 * to THIS host's wiki check. Two of the four things it checks are statements
 * about the delegation itself, so collapsing this file would leave them with no
 * subject:
 *
 * - `wiki-registry.ts` stamps the host's reviewer policy onto a descriptor by
 *   selecting `descriptor.flows.includes("coding/WikiCheck")`. A module that is
 *   its own flow names no flows, so nothing would carry the stamp and the
 *   policy check could never pass.
 * - `wiki-check.ts` requires the catalog entry's `delegate` to be
 *   `coding/WikiCheck`, the flow this host registered. A self-flowed descriptor
 *   reports no delegate at all, which every collapsed flow under `flows/` also
 *   reports, so the check would stop distinguishing them.
 *
 * The third thing it reads, `invocation.flow`, is NOT the obstacle: a
 * self-delegating module reaches the same value through
 * `FlowRuntime.FlowInstance.flow._tag`, because the bridge inlines its graph
 * into the execution it tags with the descriptor's registry name.
