/**
 * Structural model seam coordinated read-only with `packages/smithers/agent/model`.
 *
 * These shapes are a structural copy of `@smthrs/model`'s request, event, and
 * error contracts, and the copy is deliberate: a third-party engine subject or
 * scorer implements `ModelLike` without adopting the model package's classes,
 * and a recorded fixture stores plain data rather than a `Schema.Class`
 * instance whose shape would change with the class.
 *
 * It is NOT a way to avoid depending on `@smthrs/model`. This package depends
 * on it, and `CachedModel` and `RecordingModel` import it directly to wrap the
 * real provider seam. That is what the earlier wording here claimed, and it was
 * never true. The two shapes can therefore drift, and
 * `test/ModelLikeParity.test.ts` is what stops them: it asserts, at compile
 * time, that a production request, event, and error are assignable to the
 * structural copies a fixture stores.
