/**
 * Machine-global fault primitives: real process kills, and a skewed wall clock.
 *
 * Nothing here simulates a fault. `killProcess` sends a real signal to a real
 * pid and refuses to return until the operating system has reaped it, so a
 * suite can never claim it injected a fault against a process that was already
 * dead. The orphan helpers answer the question a kill leaves behind: a child
 * the killed process started is reparented to init, and a runtime that claims
 * containment has to be the thing that reaps it. `skewClock` moves the clock a
 * durable timer is measured against, which is the only way to observe what a
 * restarted host does with a deadline that has already passed.
 *
 * Both are process-global, which is why a suite built on them declares itself
 * a fault tier — `Smithers.FaultSuite`, `vitest.faults.config.ts`, no file
 * parallelism — instead of sitting beside a package's unit tests. They live
 * here rather than in each package that injects faults so there is one
 * implementation of "the process is really gone" for every one of them.
