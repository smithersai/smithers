/**
 * The contract's success arm, in the kernel's own package.
 *
 * `TestHost` and `UnsupportedHost` between them declare almost everything as
 * unsupported — a scripted interpreter takes no stdin, and a browser-shaped
 * bundle has no jj and no network — so the suite's "declared supported"
 * branches for stdin, Jj, and HttpClient would otherwise go unasserted
 * here. The real bundles that exercise them live in `@smthrs/platform-node`
 * and `@smthrs/platform-bun`, which the kernel must not depend on: a
 * capability kernel that needed a platform package to be tested would not be
 * a kernel.
 *
 * So this bundle answers every capability successfully, with the smallest
 * doubles that can. It pins the suite, not any platform.
 *
 * It also takes **every default the suite offers** — no `execCommand`, no
 * `scratchPath`. Those `??` fallbacks are the suite's own contract with an
 * adapter author who declares nothing, and the only other bundle that
 * exercised them (`NodeHostDefaults`) now lives in `@smthrs/platform-node`.
 * A default nobody runs is a default nobody has checked.
