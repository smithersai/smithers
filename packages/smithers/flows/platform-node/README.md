# @smthrs/platform-node

Release candidate scope, host requirements and compatibility review are defined in the [library support policy](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/RELEASE_SUPPORT.md).

**Documentation:** https://platform-node.smithers.sh

The Node.js Host bundle for Smithers. One layer, `NodeHost.layer`, provides the
five services a program runs its side effects through: a filesystem, a path
helper, a child-process spawner, a [Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/)
adapter, and an HTTP client.

`@effect/platform-node` already ships Node implementations of most of those, and
this package uses them where they fit. Three guarantees are not ones a
general-purpose adapter makes, so this package implements them itself:

- **A filesystem a symlink cannot redirect.** `AtomicFileSystem` opens the
  workspace root once, walks each component with `O_NOFOLLOW`, and performs the
  final syscall relative to a pinned directory descriptor, so a path swapped
  between the permission check and the operation cannot redirect it.
- **Child processes a crashed host does not leave behind.**
  `NodeHost.layerContained` gives every child a `SIGTERM`-then-`SIGKILL`
  deadline and a durable ledger record, and sweeps the records a previous
  incarnation abandoned while the layer is built.
- **An honest answer about whether a run's owner is still alive.**
  `HostLiveness.isAlive` is the probe a durable engine consults before it takes
  a run some other process recorded itself as owning. Ambiguity resolves toward
  alive, because stranding a run is cheaper than running it twice.

## Availability

`@smthrs/platform-node` is not on npm at 1.0.0-rc.0. Its source lives in the
[smithers repository](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers), and the
[installation page](https://platform-node.smithers.sh/installation/) covers how
to depend on it from a checkout and the `effect` version it pins.

Running the bundle needs a POSIX host with Node.js 26.4.0 or later and CPython
3, which `AtomicFileSystem` uses to reach the `dir_fd` syscalls Node does not
expose. Windows is unsupported.

## Run a command through the host

```ts
import { NodeHost } from "@smthrs/platform-node"
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as ChildProcess from "effect/unstable/process/ChildProcess"
import { ChildProcessSpawner } from "effect/unstable/process/ChildProcessSpawner"

const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const spawner = yield* ChildProcessSpawner
  return yield* spawner.string(ChildProcess.make("git", ["status", "--short"]))
})

Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, NodeHost.layer))
```

`ChildProcess` and `ChildProcessSpawner` are Effect's own tags. The same layer
also provided the `FileSystem`, `Path`, `Jj`, and `HttpClient` that program did
not ask for.

## Layers

| Layer                              | What it adds                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NodeHost.layer`                   | the five tags, with `Jj` bound to the process working directory   |
| `NodeHost.layerAt(root)`           | the same, with `Jj` pinned to one absolute repository root        |
| `NodeHost.layerContained(options)` | process containment: kill deadlines, ledger records, a reap sweep |
| `NodeHost.layerContainedAt(...)`   | both, which is what the flow engine's `NodeRuntime` composes      |

The contained layers require a `ProcessLedger`, because the durable half of
containment is only as good as the journal underneath it. `ProcessLedger.layer`
inherits a crashed incarnation's processes; `ProcessLedger.layerMemory` contains
this one and nothing more.

```ts
import { ProcessLedger } from "@smthrs/kernel"
import { NodeHost } from "@smthrs/platform-node"
import { Layer } from "effect"

const host = Layer.provide(
  NodeHost.layerContained({ graceMs: 2000 }),
  ProcessLedger.layer({ hostId: "engine-1", ownerPid: process.pid })
)
```

The contained spawner prepares a supervisor and records its identity before
activating the target. On POSIX `handle.pid` names that owner, while
`exitCode` and `isRunning` describe the target. Natural target exit still
cleans up its owned group, including children holding output open. Use the
handle's `kill` for signal delivery; cleanup failure retains the ledger record.
`ScopedProcess` supplies this lifetime policy for transient commands without a
durable ledger, and exposes the separate native `Handle.targetPid` for diagnostics.

Complete host bundles require jj 0.39.0 or newer. Construction probes the binary through its selected runner; a contained host records and retires this probe in its process ledger and can fail with `JjError` (`not_installed` or `unsupported_version`). Repository commands use the selected process runner.

## Modules

The barrel exports four namespaces: `NodeHost`, `HostLiveness`,
`ProcessReaper`, and `ScopedProcess`. `AtomicFileSystem` is deliberately not among them; it is reached
as `NodeHost.AtomicFileSystem` or through the
`@smthrs/platform-node/AtomicFileSystem` subpath.

| Module             | What it provides                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NodeHost`         | the complete closed Host bundle, plus re-exports of `AtomicFileSystem`, `ProcessReaper`, `NodeCrypto`, and Effect's raw `NodeFileSystem`, spawner, and `HttpClient`                  |
| `AtomicFileSystem` | the descriptor-relative, no-follow filesystem layer and its options, ceilings, and glob grammar                                                                                      |
| `HostLiveness`     | whether a recorded run owner is still alive: `isAlive`, `Owner`, `Options`                                                                                                           |
| `ProcessReaper`    | live containment and restart reconciliation: `layerSpawner`, `SpawnerOptions`, `processLifecycle`, `reap`, `layer`, `System`, `Refusal`, `posixSystem`, `windowsSystem`, `systemFor` |
| `ScopedProcess`    | transient scoped commands with the same lifecycle: `Options`, `Handle`, `spawn`, `Status`, `status`                                                                                  |

`NodeCrypto` is re-exported for a different reason than the rest: `Crypto` is not
a Host service, so it is not in the closed list, but every durable composition
needs one and a program that already depends on this package for its host should
not need a second dependency for the digest.

## What the bundle does not provide

**There is no shell service.** Running a command is Effect's `ChildProcess` and
`ChildProcessSpawner`, so a wall-clock budget is `Effect.timeout` around the
effect and cancellation is fiber interruption, not an `AbortSignal`.

**There is no HTTP service.** An outgoing request is Effect's `HttpClient`,
provided here as `NodeHttpClient.layerUndici`. Undici installs no redirect
interceptor, so every hop stays a separate, checkable request.

Both are what lets [`@smthrs/kernel`](https://kernel.smithers.sh) check
`proc:spawn` against the rendered command line before any process starts, and
`net:get` / `net:post` against the host of every URL a request reaches,
redirect targets included. Wrap the bundle in its `HostServices.layer` to get
that permission-aware projection.

## Where this sits

[`@smthrs/flows`](https://flows.smithers.sh) is the durable flow engine: flows,
actions, the journal, and the runtime that replays a crashed run from where it
stopped. It deliberately re-exports no `@smthrs/platform-*` package, for the
same reason `effect`'s own index does not re-export `@effect/platform-node`:
the program that runs picks its platform. So a Node program installs
`@smthrs/flows` for the engine and this package for the machine underneath it,
and its `NodeRuntime` composes `NodeHost.layerContainedAt` plus
`HostLiveness.isAlive` from one options object.

## Read next

The documentation site covers the rest: [the host bundle](https://platform-node.smithers.sh/concepts/host-bundle/), [the descriptor-relative filesystem](https://platform-node.smithers.sh/concepts/descriptor-relative-filesystem/)
and everything it refuses, [process containment](https://platform-node.smithers.sh/concepts/process-containment/)
and every guard checked before a reap, the [API reference](https://platform-node.smithers.sh/reference/api/), and
[troubleshooting](https://platform-node.smithers.sh/troubleshooting/).

For a different runtime, the sibling bundles are
[`@smthrs/platform-bun`](https://platform-bun.smithers.sh) and
[`@smthrs/platform-browser`](https://platform-browser.smithers.sh).

The host exports `implementationIds` for its five service slots. Its rooted
factories reject invalid roots before constructing a layer, using the host's
own error with code `invalid_repository_root`.

The atomic filesystem supports descriptor-based `chmod` and `chown` on regular files so replacements can preserve permissions and ownership. Symlinks, hard-linked files, directories, and special files are refused by this boundary.
