/**
 * Aggregate Node.js Host bundle.
 *
 * This module defines the `NodeHost` service union and a single `layer` that
 * provides the closed Host surface backed by Node: `@effect/platform-node`'s
 * filesystem, child-process spawner and Undici `HttpClient`, Effect's `Path`,
 * and the Node `Jj` adapter from its own package. Use the layer when a Node
 * program wants every host capability from one place; use the individual
 * modules when a program should only be able to reach part of the host.
 *
 * There is no Node HTTP module either: outgoing requests are Effect's
 * `HttpClient`, and `@effect/platform-node` already ships the Undici-backed
 * implementation. Undici follows no redirect unless a redirect interceptor is
 * installed, so every hop stays visible to `@smthrs/kernel`'s decorator.
 *
 * There is no Node shell module: running a command is Effect's
 * `ChildProcessSpawner`, and `@effect/platform-node` already ships the
 * implementation.

 * dies without closing its scopes abandons every child it started. This layer

 * `ProcessLedger`, then sweeps the records a previous incarnation of the same
 * host left behind before it hands the host over
 * ({@link ProcessReaper.reap}).

 * jj is contained here too: `layerContained` builds the `Jj` service over the
 * same spawner rather than letting it start its own children, so a `jj`
 * invocation a crashed host left running is a record the next incarnation
 * reaps like any other.
 *
 * The ledger is a requirement rather than a default because the durable half
 * of containment is only as good as the journal underneath it:
 * `ProcessLedger.layer` inherits a crashed incarnation's processes,
 * `ProcessLedger.layerMemory` contains this incarnation and nothing more, and
