/**
 * Descriptor-relative filesystem operations for the capability kernel.
 *
 * Node does not expose `openat(2)` / `renameat(2)`. This adapter delegates
 * each operation to a small POSIX helper. The helper opens the filesystem
 * root once, walks every component with `O_NOFOLLOW`, and performs the final
 * syscall relative to a pinned parent descriptor. Missing Python/POSIX
 * primitives are reported as a typed, fail-closed platform error.
 *
 * **Host prerequisite.** A POSIX host with CPython 3 installed at
 * {@link defaultExecutable} (`/usr/bin/python3`), whose `os` module supports
 * `O_NOFOLLOW`, `O_DIRECTORY`, and `dir_fd` for `open`, `mkdir`, `readlink`,
 * `rename`, `rmdir`, `stat`, and `unlink`. A host that installs its
 * interpreter somewhere else configures the absolute path through
 * {@link layerWith}. **Windows is not supported**: it has none of these
 * primitives, and `/usr/bin/python3` does not exist there, so every operation
 * fails closed rather than falling back to a path-based call.
 *
 * The interpreter is addressed by absolute path and never looked up through
 * `PATH`, and the helper runs isolated from the ambient environment — an inert
 * working directory, an empty environment, no module search path entry for the
 * cwd or `PYTHONPATH`, and UTF-8 pinned for the request, the response, and the
 * filesystem encoding — so neither the workspace it confines nor the
 * environment it was started under can change what it executes or which path
 * it addresses.
 *
 * Both directions of the helper protocol are length-framed and bounded by
 * {@link defaultLimits}, so neither a large file nor a malfunctioning helper
 * can make the host allocate without limit.
 *
 * **Cost.** Each ordinary operation or bounded read batch starts one CPython
 * helper. Batches amortize interpreter startup over up to 128 operations on
 * one pinned root. {@link Options.concurrency} exists because without a
 * ceiling an `Effect.forEach(..., { concurrency: "unbounded" })` over fifty
 * paths starts fifty interpreters at once. Batch a wide fan-out, and prefer one
 * recursive `readDirectory` (one fork for the whole tree) to a read per entry.
 * {@link Options.timeoutMs} is the wall-clock backstop underneath all of it.

 * - `request` bounds the framed request; an over-limit request is refused

 * - `response` bounds the framed response, and is what a directory listing is

 * - `batchEntry` bounds one batch member's encoded success or failure envelope.
 * - `batchSize` bounds the number of operations in one batch, at most 128.
