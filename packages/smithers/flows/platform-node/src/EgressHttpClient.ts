/**
 * The outbound HTTP client a Node process should use, read off its environment.
 *
 * `@effect/platform-node` ships `NodeHttpClient.layerUndici`, and its
 * dispatcher is a bare Undici `Agent`. A bare `Agent` dials every origin
 * directly: it does not read `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `NO_PROXY`, and
 * nothing at the call site says so. That is invisible on a developer machine
 * with open egress and fatal inside a sandbox whose egress is default-deny
 * behind a named proxy — the request leaves for the origin, the firewall drops
 * it, and the only symptom is a transport failure far from the composition
 * that chose the client.
 *
 * This module is the one place that decision is made. {@link layer} is the
 * client every Node host composition installs; it honours the proxy the
 * environment names and is exactly `NodeHttpClient.layerUndici` when the
 * environment names none, so an unproxied host is unchanged.
 *
 * The rule for loopback is fixed here, not by the environment: `localhost`,
 * `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` are always reached directly, even when the
 * environment names a proxy and no exclusion, and every other origin follows
 * `NO_PROXY`. A proxy is how a process leaves its machine, and
 * `--remote http://127.0.0.1:3000` is not leaving it. The exemption is those
 * three names and nothing wider: Undici matches `NO_PROXY` entries by name,
 * never by resolved address, so `127.0.0.2` or a hostname that resolves to
 * loopback is an origin like any other and goes through the proxy.
 *

 * that names a proxy to reach the internet would also send `smthrs --remote
 * http://127.0.0.1:3000` and a local Ollama at `http://localhost:11434` to it.
 * Nothing in this repository has ever needed `NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1`, because the
 * client these compositions used before ignored the proxy variables outright.
 * So loopback is always excluded, the way Go's `net/http.ProxyFromEnvironment`
 * excludes it, and the environment's own entries are kept beside it.
 *
 * `*` is returned untouched: Undici recognises the wildcard only as the entire
 * value, and it already means every origin is direct.
