/**
 * Reaping the processes a dead host incarnation abandoned.
 *
 * Scope closure cleans up work a live host still owns. On POSIX, a prepared
 * supervisor also receives private-channel EOF when its host disappears and
 * independently requests group cleanup. The durable ledger remains the fallback
 * when that cleanup is incomplete or cannot be verified; the next incarnation
 * uses this module to examine the recorded process identities before acting.
 *
 * The rules are narrow on purpose, because the input is a durable record that
 * outlived the process that wrote it and a pid is reused. A record is signalled
 * only when ALL of these hold:
 *
 * - it belongs to a DIFFERENT incarnation of the SAME `hostId`
 *   ({@link ProcessLedger.Service.orphans} already filters that);
 * - its owner is gone. A pid that exists but belongs to another user counts as
 *   alive, exactly as {@link HostLiveness} counts it, so only `ESRCH` reads as
 *   dead and every other answer keeps the record;
 * - it names a target the platform can actually signal. On POSIX that is a
 *   process group the child leads itself, so `pgid` has to be a safe integer
 *   above 1 and equal to `pid`; on Windows it is a pid, so `pgid` has to be
 *   absent. The check is made against the DURABLE record rather than trusted
 *   from it: `process.kill(-0, "SIGKILL")` signals this host's own process
 *   group, and `@smthrs/kernel`'s ledger schema admits zero;
 * - that group is not THIS process's group, and its pid is not this process's
 *   pid. The host's real process group is read from the operating system,
 *   because a stored number can claim anything and the shell that started this
 *   host shares its group. A host that cannot read its own group keeps the
 *   record rather than signalling it on a guard that did not run;
 * - the number still names the process the record describes. A record written
 *   before this machine booted names a pid from a pid space that no longer
 *   exists, and within one boot the recorded start time has to match the start
 *   time the operating system reports for that pid. A host that cannot ASK the
 *   question answers {@link StartTime} `unavailable`, which refuses the kill
 *   and keeps the record; no evidence never authorizes a signal.
 *
 * The outcome of the signal is part of the record. A kill that succeeds, or
 * that reports the group is already gone, retires the record through
 * {@link ProcessLedger.Service.reaped}; a kill that FAILS for any other reason
 * leaves the record inherited so the next incarnation tries again. A record
 * refused on grounds the operating system will not revisit — a number no
 * platform can signal, a pid that is gone, a start time that does not match — is
 * retired through {@link ProcessLedger.Service.skipped}, which says in the
 * journal that nothing was signalled and stops every later incarnation
 * re-examining a number the operating system has moved on from. The three
 * refusals a later incarnation CAN answer differently — `owner-alive`,
 * `identity-unverified`, and `own-group-unknown` — retire nothing.
