/**
 * The guarded, descriptor-relative filesystem, executed on this runtime.
 *
 * `BunFileSystem.layer` is `@smthrs/platform-node`'s `AtomicFileSystem.layer`,
 * and its no-follow extension does not run in-process: every guarded operation
 * is executed by a CPython 3 helper the adapter spawns. The extension being
 * *present* is all the barrel suite asserts, and nothing in this package had
 * ever run it, so this suite executes it once against the adapter the Bun
 * bundle actually installs: a guarded read, write, and rename, plus one
 * symlink-swap refusal.
 *
 * The Node coverage lane and the Bun compatibility lane both run this file,
 * so each runtime must start the helper and complete the guarded operations.
 *
 * The byte ceilings, the Unicode matrix, and the full refusal matrix already
 * run against the byte-identical module in
 * `packages/smithers/flows/platform-node/test/AtomicFileSystem*`, and are deliberately not
 * restaged here.
 *
 * `it.live` throughout: the helper is a real subprocess on real elapsed time.
