Smithers programs do not call `node:fs`, `Bun.spawn`, or a global `fetch`.
Everything that touches the outside world enters through a closed list of five
Effect service tags, and a host bundle is the thing that fills them:

| Slot            | Tag                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Filesystem      | `effect/FileSystem`                           |
| Path            | `effect/Path`                                 |
| Child processes | `effect/unstable/process/ChildProcessSpawner` |
| Version control | `Jj`, from [`@smthrs/jj`](/api/jj)            |
| Network         | `effect/unstable/http/HttpClient`             |

The list is closed for one reason, owned by
[`@smthrs/kernel`](/api/kernel): a service that is not on it cannot be
attenuated, denied, or audited, so it must not exist.

Closing the list does not make the platform implementations part of a step's
identity. [`@smthrs/plan`](/api/plan)'s step key digests only the `layers` its
caller passes it, so "which platform implementations were in scope" is an
explicit input a caller supplies, not something this bundle contributes. The
identity table below is data to pass; nothing reads it for you.

`BunHost.layer` provides all five, and `BunHost` is the type union of them:

```ts
export type BunHost = FileSystem | Path.Path | ChildProcessSpawner | Jj | HttpClient
```

## What fills each slot, and whose code it is

`BunHost.implementationIds` is this mapping as data, so a swapped
implementation is a visible change to a public value rather than a comment
that drifted:

```ts
import { BunHost } from "@smthrs/platform-bun"

BunHost.implementationIds
// {
//   "effect/FileSystem": "@smthrs/platform-node/AtomicFileSystem",
//   "effect/Path": "@effect/platform-bun/BunPath",
//   "effect/process/ChildProcessSpawner": "@effect/platform-bun/BunChildProcessSpawner",
//   "@smthrs/jj/Jj": "@smthrs/jj/bun/BunJj",
//   "effect/HttpClient": "@effect/platform-bun/BunHttpClient"
// }
```

Each value names the module actually behind the slot, not the specifier you
import it through. The filesystem entry says
`@smthrs/platform-node/AtomicFileSystem` because that is the implementation,
even though a Bun program reaches it through this package. Each key is the
slot's stable identity in the closed list, which is likewise not always the
specifier the tag comes from: the spawner key is
`effect/process/ChildProcessSpawner` while its tag is imported from
`effect/unstable/process/ChildProcessSpawner`.

Nothing digests these values today. [`@smthrs/plan`](/api/plan)'s step key
carries a `layers` component they are meant to feed, but no planner derives it
from a host bundle yet, so changing one invalidates no cached step.

## Three slots the bundle does not implement

**Path** is runtime independent. `effect/Path`'s own layer goes in the slot
unchanged, and the kernel keeps `Path` on the closed list as an explicit
pass-through decision rather than dropping it.

**Child processes** are Effect's. `@effect/platform-bun`'s
`BunChildProcessSpawner` is `@effect/platform-node-shared`'s spawner
re-exported, which means Bun and Node run literally the same module. There is
no Bun shell wrapper here and no runtime detection, because there is nothing
to choose between. See
[Runtime parity with Node](./runtime-parity.md) for what that means for your
program, and where the parity stops.

**The network** is Effect's `HttpClient`. There is no Smithers transport port
beneath it, because a raw port would be a second way to reach the network
whose contract never mentions permission. The bundle provides
`@effect/platform-bun`'s fetch-backed client, and configures exactly one thing
about it.

## The one thing configured about the network: manual redirects

```ts
const layerHttpClient: Layer.Layer<HttpClient> = Layer.provide(
  BunHttpClient.layer,
  Layer.succeed(BunHttpClient.RequestInit)({ redirect: "manual" })
)
```

A `302` therefore comes back to the caller as a `302`, with its `location`
header intact and the second origin never contacted. That is deliberate: a
client that follows a redirect on its own reaches a host the capability kernel
never authorized. Following a redirect is the kernel's guarded
`HttpClient.layer`, which rechecks the capability on every hop.

## Two slots the bundle composes from Smithers packages

**Version control** is `Jj`, the service whose methods make a step reversible:
snapshot, restore, diff, workspace lanes. It runs the `jj` command from
[Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io), a version-control system that works on a
Git repository, so the slot needs that binary on the host. Bun's adapter is
`@smthrs/jj/bun/BunJj`, which is the Node adapter under another name because
Bun implements the child-process API it uses. The adapter is imported from
[`@smthrs/jj`](/api/jj) and deliberately not re-exported here: it belongs to
that package.

**The filesystem** is `@smthrs/platform-node`'s `AtomicFileSystem`, byte for
byte the layer [`@smthrs/platform-node`](/api/platform-node) puts in its own
filesystem slot. It carries the kernel's atomic host extension, which is what
lets the kernel's guarded `FileSystem.layer` perform a guarded path operation
descriptor-relative and no-follow instead of failing closed. With the
extension, the operation runs against file descriptors, so a symlink swapped in
after authorization cannot redirect it somewhere else. Without a working one,
every guarded path operation is refused with a typed `PermissionDenied` rather
than falling back to a path-based call, because the fallback is the race the
extension exists to prevent.

That extension executes its syscalls in a CPython 3 subprocess rather than
in-process, which is why the host needs an interpreter. See
[Run where python3 is not at /usr/bin/python3](../guides/configure-the-filesystem-helper.md).

## Taking one service without the other four

`BunHost` re-exports the four single-slot modules, so a program that should
reach only part of the host has one import to take it from:

```ts
import { BunHost } from "@smthrs/platform-bun"

BunHost.AtomicFileSystem // the filesystem implementation, with its options
BunHost.BunFileSystem // the filesystem slot as this package spells it
BunHost.BunChildProcessSpawner
BunHost.BunHttpClient
```

`AtomicFileSystem` is in that set for a specific reason: it owns the only
configuration escape hatch the filesystem slot has, and a Bun program whose
python3 is not at `/usr/bin/python3` must be able to reach
`AtomicFileSystem.layerWith` without adding
[`@smthrs/platform-node`](/api/platform-node) as a second dependency.

Composing individual slots yourself means you own the closure. `BunHost.layer`
is the only thing that guarantees all five are present and consistent; a
hand-composed subset is a surface the kernel can still guard, but not one this
package pins.
