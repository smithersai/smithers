`@smthrs/flows` has three public entry points.

| Entry point                   | Contents                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@smthrs/flows`               | The barrel: nineteen engine packages re-exported, plus `namespaces`. Browser-safe. |
| `@smthrs/flows/Runtime`       | Shared engine/storage composition over injected Effect SQL and host services.      |
| `@smthrs/flows/NodeRuntime`   | Native Node composition, preserving the existing API.                              |
| `@smthrs/flows/BunRuntime`    | Native Bun composition using the Bun SQL adapter.                                  |
| `@smthrs/flows/SandboxedFlow` | Running a child flow's own code inside a provisioned machine. Node-only.           |

```ts
import { Action, Flow, Kernel, RunStore } from "@smthrs/flows"
import * as NodeRuntime from "@smthrs/flows/NodeRuntime"
import * as SandboxedFlow from "@smthrs/flows/SandboxedFlow"
```

`@smthrs/flows/internal/*` and `@smthrs/flows/*/index` are blocked in the export
map and are not public.

Durable execution is supported on Node.js 22.19.0 or later with local SQLite.
The root entry point bundles for browsers, which buys authoring and inspection;
it does not make a browser a durable host, and supplying another SQL client does
not change that.

## The barrel

### Namespace exports

Each engine package is re-exported as a namespace, so a package's own module is
one level below it (`Journal.SqlJournal.layer`).

| Namespace       | Package                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Artifacts`     | [`@smthrs/artifacts`](/api/artifacts)         |
| `Canonical`     | [`@smthrs/canonical`](/api/canonical)         |
| `Capability`    | [`@smthrs/capability`](/api/capability)       |
| `Crypto`        | [`@smthrs/crypto`](/api/crypto)               |
| `Database`      | [`@smthrs/database`](/api/database)           |
| `Engine`        | [`@smthrs/engine`](/api/engine)               |
| `EngineStore`   | [`@smthrs/engine-store`](/api/engine-store)   |
| `Jj`            | [`@smthrs/jj`](/api/jj)                       |
| `Journal`       | [`@smthrs/journal`](/api/journal)             |
| `Kernel`        | [`@smthrs/kernel`](/api/kernel)               |
| `Keys`          | [`@smthrs/keys`](/api/keys)                   |
| `Observability` | [`@smthrs/observability`](/api/observability) |
| `Plan`          | [`@smthrs/plan`](/api/plan)                   |
| `RunStore`      | [`@smthrs/run-store`](/api/run-store)         |
| `Sandbox`       | [`@smthrs/sandbox`](/api/sandbox)             |
| `StepCache`     | [`@smthrs/step-cache`](/api/step-cache)       |
| `Sync`          | [`@smthrs/sync`](/api/smithers-sync)          |

Namespacing is what preserves constructors like
`Kernel.ChildProcessSpawner.layerNoop` and `RunStore.RunStore.layer`. The
`Capability` namespace owns exact-resource bounds, the pattern grammar, and
permission failures; `Plan` owns step identity, graph compilation, static effect
declarations, and plan storage; `Journal` owns the append-only event record
every durable run replays from and the redaction rules that keep a credential
out of both a committed row and a log line.

### Flat exports

[`@smthrs/flow`](/api/flow) is re-exported flat, so all fourteen authoring names
sit at the top level: `Action`, `DurableClock`, `DurableDeferred`,
`DurableQueue`, `Flow`, `FlowRuntime`, `Graph`, `HumanTask`, `Interpreter`,
`Poll`, `RetryPolicy`, `Sleep`, `StepIdentity`, and `WaitFor`.

`TimeTravel` from [`@smthrs/time-travel`](/api/time-travel) is the second flat
export, and it is a service key rather than a namespace:

```ts
import { TimeTravel } from "@smthrs/flows"

const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const timeTravel = yield* TimeTravel
})
```

`TimeTravel.layer` provides it. The rest of that package, including `Frame`,
`TimeTravelStore`, and `EffectBoundary`, is reached through
`@smthrs/time-travel` directly.

The `@smthrs/platform-*` bundles are deliberately absent. A program chooses
[`@smthrs/platform-node`](/api/platform-node),
[`@smthrs/platform-bun`](/api/platform-bun), or
[`@smthrs/platform-browser`](/api/platform-browser) directly.

### `namespaces`

```ts
const namespaces: ReadonlyArray<string>
```

The sorted list of every name this barrel exports, covering both the per-package
namespaces and the flat authoring names. It is the package's one runtime value,
and it names the whole engine: enumerate it to build a documentation index or a
conformance check over the surface you depend on.

## NodeRuntime

```ts
import * as NodeRuntime from "@smthrs/flows/NodeRuntime"
```

The supported Node composition. Importing this module opens `node:sqlite`
through `@smthrs/database/node/NodeDatabase`, which is why the browser-safe root
does not re-export it.

Construction is ordered by layer dependency: the SQLite parent directory is
created before the database opens, migrations finish before any store is built,
the engine is built over those stores, and `registerFlows` finishes before the
resulting services are exposed. A persisted run therefore cannot resume through
a composition before its flow has been registered.

### `Options`

Configuration for `make` and `layer`.

| Field           | Type                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `filename`      | `string`                  | SQLite database filename. Resolved to an absolute path at the call; its parent directory is created recursively.                                                                                                                           |
| `workspaceRoot` | `string`                  | The workspace file actions may read or mutate. Resolved to an absolute path at the call.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `owner`         | `{ hostId: string }`      | Stable identity of this engine host.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `isAlive`       | `Ownership.LivenessCheck` | Whether a previously recorded owner is still alive. Required, and a stub is not an answer: a check that returns `false` without asking makes the engine steal runs out of live processes. Receives the claim context as well as the owner. |

`Ownership.sameHostPidProbe` from [`@smthrs/run-store`](/api/run-store) probes
the process table only for the claim context's host (`context.claimant.hostId`).
It returns `false` (treated as dead) for an owner on another host, allowing
takeover once that owner's lease has expired. A fresh heartbeat still blocks
takeover. To preserve foreign-host owners, use `HostLiveness.isAlive({ hostId })`
from [`@smthrs/platform-node`](/api/platform-node), which returns `true` for
foreign hosts, or supply a distributed liveness check. `HostLiveness.isAlive`
is the `layerHost` default and refuses foreign-host takeover even after lease
expiry. A multi-process deployment answers from its supervisor or lease system.

### `RuntimeConfigurationError`

```ts
class RuntimeConfigurationError extends Schema.TaggedError("@smthrs/flows/RuntimeConfigurationError")({
  code: "invalid_runtime_configuration"
  field: string
  message: string
})
```

Thrown synchronously by `storage`, `make`, `layer`, and `layerHost` for invalid
construction input. `field` names the single option that was wrong, so an
embedder can distinguish an empty `filename` from an empty `owner.hostId`
without parsing the message. Nothing is created before it is thrown: no database
is opened and no signal listener is installed.

### `storage`

```ts
const storage: (filename: string, workspaceRoot?: string) => Layer<...>
```

Provides the migrated database, the durable stores (`SqlJournal`, `RunStore`,
`AttemptStore`, `CacheStore`, `DurableEngineState`), the `OwnerIdentity` minter,
the `Workspace`, and a filesystem `ArtifactStore`, and constructs no engine.

`workspaceRoot` defaults to the database file's own directory. The journal queue
is created with capacity 1,024 and `overflow: "reject"`. Artifacts live beside
the database under `objects/`, so a database at `<root>/.flows/engine.db` stores
blobs in `<root>/.flows/objects`.

This is the lower-level seam for an integration that builds another
engine-backed service over the same storage context. Application entry points
normally use `layer` or `layerHost`.

### `make`

```ts
const make: (
  options: Options,
  stepBoundary: Layer<StepBoundary.Service, E1, R1>,
  workspaceSandbox: Layer<WorkspaceSandbox.Service, E2, R2>,
  registerFlows: Layer<A, E3, R3>,
  registry?: Layer<A4, E4, R4>
) => Effect<Context<...>, ..., Crypto | FileSystem | Jj | Scope>
```

Builds the production service context in the current scope and returns it. The
caller selects the filesystem boundary and workspace sandbox layers and supplies
a registration layer, typically a merge of action implementation layers and
`Interpreter.layer(flow)`. `Jj`, Effect's `FileSystem`, and Effect's `Crypto`
remain requirements. Closing the surrounding scope closes the database, the
journal writer, the sweeper, and the active engine fibers through their existing
finalizers.

### `layer`

```ts
const layer: (
  options: Options,
  stepBoundary: Layer<StepBoundary.Service, E1, R1>,
  workspaceSandbox: Layer<WorkspaceSandbox.Service, E2, R2>,
  registerFlows: Layer<A, E3, R3>,
  registry?: Layer<A4, E4, R4>
) => Layer<..., ..., Crypto | FileSystem | Jj>
```

The same composition as a scoped `Layer`. `registerFlows` is the final startup
phase rather than a layer merged beside the engine, which serializes the
durability-sensitive order. Shutdown is scope closure; this function installs no
process or signal handlers.

`registry` is the optional catalog the registration phase reads from. A host that
discovers its flows rather than listing them passes
[`@smthrs/registry`](/api/registry)'s `Executable.layerProject({ root })`, and
builds `registerFlows` from `Executable.layer(...)`. The registry is provided
beneath registration and above the engine, so every discovered flow is
registered before the runtime accepts a launch. Omitting it is exactly the
registry-free behavior.

`make` and `layer` are overloaded on the registry argument rather than defaulting
it, because a default cannot honor a caller-chosen registry type. Naming a
registry type without passing its layer does not compile.

### `HostOptions`

Configuration for `layerHost`. Only `filename`, `workspaceRoot`, and `owner` are
required.

| Field               | Type                                               | Default                            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filename`          | `string`                                           | required                           | SQLite database filename. Its parent directory is created recursively.                                                                                                                               |
| `workspaceRoot`     | `string`                                           | required                           | The project workspace, resolved once while the host is constructed. Every Jj operation stays bound to that root.                                                                                     |
| `owner`             | `{ hostId: string }`                               | required                           | Stable identity of this engine host.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `isAlive`           | `Ownership.LivenessCheck`                          | `HostLiveness.isAlive({ hostId })` | Whether a recorded owner is still alive. The default answers from this machine's process table and never declares another host's owner dead.                                                         |
| `rules`             | `GrantStore.MakeOptions["rules"]`                  | none                               | The capability rules this host grants without asking. The grant store is unattended, so a capability no rule allows is denied rather than escalated. Accepts a flat rule list or a list of rulesets. |
| `signals`           | `ReadonlyArray<NodeJS.Signals>`                    | `["SIGINT", "SIGTERM"]`            | The signals that shut the runtime down. An empty list installs no handler at all.                                                                                                                    |
| `shutdownTimeoutMs` | `number`                                           | `defaultShutdownTimeoutMs`         | How long a graceful shutdown may take before the host leaves with the signal's own exit code.                                                                                                        |
| `containment`       | `ContainedSpawner.Options & ProcessReaper.Options` | none                               | Process containment and reaping options for the host spawner.                                                                                                                                        |

Every option is validated and snapshotted at the call. Rule arrays, rule
objects, signal lists, and containment callbacks are all copied, and relative
paths are resolved against the working directory as it stood at the call, so
mutating the options object afterward changes nothing.

### `defaultShutdownTimeoutMs`

```ts
const defaultShutdownTimeoutMs: 30_000
```

How long a graceful shutdown may take before the host leaves anyway.

### `maximumShutdownTimeoutMs`

```ts
const maximumShutdownTimeoutMs: 2_147_483_647
```

The largest delay Node accepts without truncating it to a one-millisecond timer,
and the upper bound `shutdownTimeoutMs` is validated against.

### `signalExitCode`

```ts
const signalExitCode: (signal: NodeJS.Signals) => number
```

The status a process ended by `signal` exits with, which is 128 plus the
signal number: `130` for `SIGINT`, `143` for `SIGTERM`. A host that installs a handler
owes its supervisor the answer the default behavior would have given.

### `layerHost`

```ts
const layerHost: (
  options: HostOptions,
  registerFlows: Layer<A, E, R>,
  registry?: Layer<A2, E2, R2>
) => Layer<...>
```

Provides the whole Node host, storage, kernel, and engine from one call. The
returned layer has no requirements of its own; the registration and registry
arguments may still declare theirs.

What it adds over `layer`:

- The complete Node host from [`@smthrs/platform-node`](/api/platform-node) with
  process containment on. A spawned process gets its own process group, is
  signalled and then killed when its action's scope closes, and is recorded in
  the `ProcessLedger` so the next incarnation of this host reaps whatever a
  crash left running.
- The kernel's guarded `Host` surface over an unattended `GrantStore`, so an
  action reaches the host through the capability check rather than around it.
  Engine snapshot bookkeeping uses a distinct private `Jj` service, so it grants
  no repository authority to the action context.
- The default `StepBoundary` and the filesystem `WorkspaceSandbox`, the pairing
  that makes a sealed action's result eligible for the step cache.
- Signal handling. `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` closes the runtime scope, releasing
  every run this host owns for another host to reclaim. A second signal, or a
  shutdown that outlasts `shutdownTimeoutMs`, leaves with the signal's own exit
  code instead of waiting on a finalizer that is not coming back.

A program that needs a different host, a different policy, or no signals at all
composes `layer` itself; nothing here is reachable only through this function.

## SandboxedFlow

```ts
import * as SandboxedFlow from "@smthrs/flows/SandboxedFlow"
```

Runs a child flow's own code inside a machine a `Sandbox.Provider` provisions.
`Sandbox.layerHost` from [`@smthrs/sandbox`](/api/sandbox) places a body's side
effects on a machine while its TypeScript keeps running in the engine host; this
module is the tier above that, where the child's own code executes in the guest.
It is Node-only: it bundles with esbuild and it starts a guest runtime.

```ts
const run = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const result = yield* SandboxedFlow.execute(Child, { n: 31 }, {
    provider,
    session: "child-1",
    entry: new URL("./child.ts", import.meta.url),
    runtime: "node",
    collectDiff: true
  })
  // result.output is Child's success value, decoded through Child's own schema.
  // result.diff is the files the guest created, as { path, bytes } data.
  return result
})
```

`provider` is a `Sandbox.Provider` value you pass in: there is no string
registry, no lookup by name, and no environment variable default. The authoring
is `Flow.make` and `Action.make`, so a sandboxed child is declared the same way
every other flow is.

The runner protocol, the guest composition, the image requirements, and the
session key's exclusivity are on
[The sandboxed runner protocol](./concepts/runner-protocol.md).

### `SandboxedFlowError`

```ts
class SandboxedFlowError extends Schema.TaggedError("@smthrs/flows/SandboxedFlowError")({
  code:
    | "bundle_failed"
    | "session_failed"
    | "guest_failed"
    | "flow_failed"
    | "result_unreadable"
    | "result_invalid"
    | "result_overflow"
    | "diff_overflow"
    | "deadline_exceeded"
  message: string
  cause?: unknown
})
```

The one failure type every refusal in this module raises.

| `code`              | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bundle_failed`     | The entry module could not be bundled.                                                                   |
| `session_failed`    | The provider could not acquire the machine, or a file or process operation on it failed.                 |
| `guest_failed`      | The guest runtime exited non-zero, including exit 126 or 127 for a runtime the image does not contain.   |
| `flow_failed`       | The child flow ran and reported a failure, including an entry that exports no flow of the requested tag. |
| `result_unreadable` | The guest exited 0 but wrote no result, or wrote one that is not the protocol's JSON.                    |
| `result_invalid`    | The result's `output` does not decode through the flow's success schema.                                 |
| `result_overflow`   | The result file exceeds `Limits.resultBytes`.                                                            |
| `diff_overflow`     | The workspace diff exceeds `Limits.files` or `Limits.diffBytes`.                                         |
| `deadline_exceeded` | The whole session outlived `ExecuteOptions.timeout`.                                                     |

Messages quote the tail of the guest's stdout and stderr where they help, cut at
4 KiB and marked when they were cut. A child's typed error arrives as its tag and
its own fields, not as a stack trace into the bundle.

### `Limits` and `ResolvedLimits`

```ts
interface Limits {
  readonly resultBytes?: number | undefined
  readonly diffBytes?: number | undefined
  readonly files?: number | undefined
}

interface ResolvedLimits {
  readonly resultBytes: number
  readonly diffBytes: number
  readonly files: number

Bounds on what comes back from the guest. An omitted or `undefined` bound keeps
its default.

### `defaultLimits`

```ts
const defaultLimits: ResolvedLimits
```

| Bound         | Default | What it caps                                      |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `resultBytes` | 5 MiB   | The result JSON the guest wrote.                  |
| `diffBytes`   | 100 MiB | The total bytes collected across the diff.        |
| `files`       | 1,000   | The number of created or resized files collected. |

Limits are inclusive and count bytes, not characters. `resultBytes` includes
the complete UTF-8 JSON envelope. Metadata can reject oversized files before
transfer; reads stop at the byte budget plus one. Actual bytes, including any
growth after stat, count toward `diffBytes` before each entry is appended.
Native filesystem streams receive `bytesToRead`; other providers use guest
`head -c`, which the image must supply. Zero permits no result bytes, no diff
bytes (empty files are allowed), or no changed files, respectively.

Guest stdout and stderr are drained concurrently with fixed-size diagnostic
tails retaining at most 4 KiB each, plus a truncation marker. Redaction runs during collection; when a credential
continues beyond a retained segment, the rest of that line is omitted. An
overlong unfinished quoted credential suppresses the rest of that stream.

### `ExecuteOptions`

| Field         | Type               | Default         | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider`    | `Sandbox.Provider` | required        | The provider that provisions the machine. A value, never a name.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `session`     | `string`           | required        | The session key the machine is acquired under. An exclusive claim: two live executions with one key share a machine, and the first to finish tears it down under the other. Reusing a key is what resume looks like.           |
| `entry`       | `URL \| string`    | required        | The module to bundle: a `file:` URL or an absolute path. It must export the flow being executed, under any name, and may export `layer`, an Effect `Layer` providing the implementations of the actions the flow's body names. |
| `runtime`     | `string`           | `"node"`        | The guest executable that runs the bundle: `"node"`, `"bun"`, or an executable path. Each path is quoted as one shell word. Use a wrapper script for flags.                                                                    |
| `collectDiff` | `boolean`          | `false`         | Whether to collect the files the guest created or resized.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `limits`      | `Limits`           | `defaultLimits` | Bounds on the result and the diff.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `timeout`     | `Duration.Input`   | 10 minutes      | The wall-clock budget for the whole session, acquisition through result readback. Uses platform timers, including chunked timers for long finite budgets. `Duration.infinity` disables the deadline.                           |

### `DiffEntry`, `Diff`, and `Result`

```ts
interface DiffEntry {
  /** The path relative to the session workdir. */
  readonly path: string
  readonly bytes: Uint8Array
}

interface Result<A> {
  readonly output: A
  readonly diff: ReadonlyArray<DiffEntry>
}

const DiffEntry: Schema.Struct<{ path: Schema.String; bytes: Schema.Uint8Array }>
const Diff: Schema.Array<typeof DiffEntry>
```

One `DiffEntry` per file the guest created or resized, as it stood when the guest
exited. The schemas are JSON-encodable for the journal: the bytes serialize as
base64.

### `resultSchema` and `ResultSchema`

```ts
type ResultSchema<Success extends Schema.Top> = Schema.Struct<{
  readonly output: Success
  readonly diff: typeof Diff
}>

const resultSchema: <Success extends Schema.Top>(success: Success) => ResultSchema<Success>
```

Builds the `Result` schema over a flow's success schema. This is what a parent
flow declares as its own `success` when its body is one sandboxed call.

### `execute`

```ts
const execute: <Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires>(
  flow: Flow.Flow<Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires>,
  payload: Payload["Type"],
  options: ExecuteOptions
) => Effect<Result<Success["Type"]>, SandboxedFlowError>
```

Runs `flow` with `payload` inside a machine `options.provider` provisions. The
session is acquired for the duration of the call and released when it returns,
so a normal completion tears the machine down and only a host crash leaves one
behind for a later execution with the same session key to reattach.

`payload` is the decoded payload, encoded through the flow's payload schema for
the wire. A value the schema's own JSON codec refuses is a programmer error and
dies, the same posture `Flow.executionId` takes.

Diff change detection compares sizes by path against a snapshot taken before the
guest ran. A created file and a file whose size changed are collected; a file
rewritten in place at its previous size on a reattached workspace is the one edit
it misses. A fresh workspace holds nothing but the protocol's own files, so every
file the child writes there is a creation.

### `SandboxedAction` and `action`

```ts
type SandboxedAction<Tag, Payload, Success> = Action.Declared<
  Tag,
  Payload,
  ResultSchema<Success>,
  typeof SandboxedFlowError
>

function action<Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires, const Name extends string>(
  flow: Flow.Flow<Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires>,
  options: { readonly name: Name }
): SandboxedAction<Name, Payload, Success>
function action<Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires, const Name extends string = never>(
  flow: Flow.Flow<Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires>,
  options?: { readonly name?: Name | undefined }
): SandboxedAction<Name | `${Tag}/sandboxed`, Payload, Success>
```

Declares the durable action a parent flow calls to run `flow` in a sandbox. Its
payload schema is the flow's, its success schema is `resultSchema` over the
flow's, and its error schema is `SandboxedFlowError`. The tag is
`<flow tag>/sandboxed` unless `options.name` says otherwise. Both forms preserve
the literal name, so providing one declaration's implementation cannot satisfy
a differently named declaration. An optional name retains both possible tags.

From the parent's point of view the whole sandboxed execution is one action: the
engine journals one attempt, applies one retry policy, and replays one recorded
result.

### `ExecuteContext`

```ts
interface ExecuteContext<Payload> {
  readonly payload: Payload
  readonly executionId: string
  readonly callId: string
}
```

What `toLayer` hands an options function: the decoded payload, the parent
execution's id, and the engine's invocation key as `callId`. Combine `executionId`
and `callId` for a session key exclusive to this call, including parallel calls
with identical payloads. `callId` is preserved across retries and resume.
A runtime that supplies no `Action.CurrentInvocationKey` is refused as a defect
before acquiring a session.

### `toLayer`

```ts
const toLayer: <ActionTag, Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires>(
  declared: SandboxedAction<ActionTag, Payload, Success>,
  flow: Flow.Flow<Tag, Payload, Success, Error, Requires>,
  options: ExecuteOptions | ((context: ExecuteContext<Payload["Type"]>) => ExecuteOptions)
) => Layer<Action.Requirement<ActionTag>, never, FlowRuntime | ...>
```

Implements an `action` declaration with `execute`. `options` is either the
placement itself or a function of the call's `ExecuteContext`:

```ts
SandboxedFlow.toLayer(RunChild, Child, ({ executionId, callId }) => ({
  provider,
  session: `child:${executionId}:${callId}`,
  entry: new URL("./child.ts", import.meta.url)
}))
```

Compose the returned layer beside `Interpreter.layer(parent)` over one
`Action.layerImplementations`, exactly as any other action implementation.

Each namespace in the table above has its own API reference, reached through the
links there. [`@smthrs/cli`](/api/cli) is this engine as the `smthrs` command
line, which builds its own durable engine through `NodeRuntime`. Depend on
individual `@smthrs` packages rather than this barrel when a smaller dependency
surface is worth the extra imports.
