/**
 * Aggregate browser platform services layer.
 *
 * This module defines the `BrowserServices` union and a single `layer` that
 * provides browser-backed child process spawning, filesystem, and path
 * services, mirroring `NodeServices` from `@effect/platform-node`.
 *
 * Unlike `NodeServices.layer`, this one is a **function**: a tab owns which
 * ZenFS backend is mounted and which just-bash instance is wired to it, and the
 * two must be the *same* filesystem or the spawner and the `FileSystem` service
 * will disagree about what exists. The signature says so.
 *
 * `Crypto`, `Stdio`, and `Terminal` are deliberately absent. `effect` core
 * ships no browser implementation of any of them, and `@effect/platform-browser`
 * — which does ship `BrowserCrypto` — is not a dependency of this repository;
 * re-exporting it here would add one. Compose it alongside this layer if you
 * need it.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0-rc.0
