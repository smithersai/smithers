 * `BrowserHost`. The slice has no recursive `readdir`, so the walk is done
 * here with the members it does have, emitting the same `parent/child` shape
 * Node emits.

 * The array returned is the caller's. The walk builds its own, and the flat
 * listing copies the backend's, so a backend that answers `readdir` from the
 * array it stores is neither changed through a result nor able to change one.
