 * Constructs a `FileSystem` over a ZenFS-shaped backend.

 * uses the backend's rename and timestamp operations when available.
 * Reads use bounded file-handle chunks rather than loading the whole file.
 *
 * The operations that *are* served honour their options rather than dropping
 * them: `readDirectory` walks the tree for `recursive`, `access` answers
 * `readable`/`writable` from the reported mode, `makeDirectory` forwards
 * `mode`, `realPath` canonicalizes, `writeFile` forwards `flag` and `mode`,
 * and `exists` reports `false` only for a path that is absent, propagating
 * every other backend failure the way effect's own derivation does.
 *
 * Bytes and names cross the backend boundary by value. `writeFile` copies
 * `data` and reads `flag` and `mode` when it is called, so the effect it
 * returns describes one write however the caller's buffer or options change
 * before it runs or between retries, and however long the backend holds the
 * bytes it was handed. `readFile` and `readDirectory` return a buffer and an
 * array the caller owns, so a backend that answers from its own storage can
 * neither be corrupted through a result nor change one already returned.
 *
 * Mutations defer interruption until the backend promise settles, so cleanup
 * and replacement writes cannot overtake an abandoned mutation. The backend
 * slice has no cancellation signal.
 *
 * The service this builds carries **no** kernel isolation attestation; `layer`
 * is the composition that makes that claim.
