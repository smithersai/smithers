/**
 * The slice of a `just-bash` interpreter instance this module depends on.
 *
 * Satisfied by the `Bash` class exported from the **`just-bash`** npm package
 * (`new Bash({ fs })`), whose method is
 * `exec(commandLine: string, options?: ExecOptions): Promise<BashExecResult>`
 * (3.2.0, `dist/Bash.d.ts`). Only the members this adapter touches are
 * declared, under their real names: `cwd`, `env`, `replaceEnv`, and `signal`
 * from `ExecOptions`, and `stdout`/`stderr`/`exitCode` from the result. The
 * real `ExecOptions` also carries a string `stdin`, which this adapter does
 * not use.
 *
 * **The returned promise must settle after `signal` aborts.** Runs are
 * serialized so two interpreters never mutate the mount at once, and the
 * serialization permit is held until the promise settles: an implementation
 * that ignores the abort and never resolves blocks every later run rather
 * than being abandoned mid-write. Rejecting with `signal.reason` is the
 * expected answer.
 *
 * We take an instance rather than the package so the browser bundle owns
 * construction — mounting the interpreter on the *same* virtual filesystem
 * `BrowserFileSystem` adapts — and so tests can hand us a stub.
