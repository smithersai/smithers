/**
 * Browser implementation of Effect's `ChildProcessSpawner` service.
 *
 * A browser tab cannot fork a process. What it can do is run a command line
 * through an in-page bash interpreter — in practice **just-bash** — over the
 * same virtual filesystem `BrowserFileSystem` is mounted on. This module adapts
 * that interpreter into a `ChildProcessSpawner` layer so `ChildProcess`
 * commands work in the browser the way they do under `NodeChildProcessSpawner`.
 *
 * **The divergences are real and are not hidden.** just-bash runs here as a
 * buffered, run-to-completion API with no process table:
 *
 * - **No incremental output.** The returned handle replays captured output
 *   after completion: `stdout` and `stderr` each emit at most one chunk, and
 *   `all` is `stdout` followed by `stderr` rather than a live interleaving.
 *   The `stdout`/`stderr` handling still
 *   mean what they mean under `NodeChildProcessSpawner` — `"inherit"` and
 *   `"ignore"` yield an empty stream, and a `Sink` is transduced through —
 *   they are just applied to captured text rather than to a live readable.
 * - **No stdin.** just-bash `exec` accepts a string `stdin`, but this adapter
 *   runs the interpreter once with captured output and has nowhere to stream
 *   into: `stdin` is a `Sink` that fails, and a command that supplies a
 *   `Stream` for stdin is rejected at spawn time rather than losing its input
 *   silently.
 * - **Abort-only signals.** Scope closure, interruption, timeout, and `kill`
 *   abort the interpreter through just-bash's `AbortSignal`, and every
 *   observable on the handle then reports a `PlatformError` naming the abort
 *   rather than replaying the interrupt into the caller's fiber. Signal names
 *   are not distinguishable in a browser tab, so `killSignal` is ignored, and
 *   there is no harder stop after the abort, so `forceKillAfter` is rejected.
 * - **One run at a time.** Runs are serialized behind a permit held until the
 *   interpreter promise settles, abort included, so two interpreters never
 *   mutate the mount at once.
 * - **No process identity.** `pid` is a per-layer counter, not an OS pid, and
 *   `unref` is a no-op: there is no parent process reference count in a tab.
 * - **No pipelines between processes.** A `PipedCommand` is rejected; write the
 *   pipeline as a single command line and let the interpreter parse the `|`.
 * - **No extra file descriptors.** `getInputFd` returns `Sink.drain` and
 *   `getOutputFd` returns `Stream.empty` — the same answer
 *   `NodeChildProcessSpawner` gives for a descriptor that was never configured.
 *   A command that explicitly configures one is rejected at spawn time.
 * - **No custom shell or detached process.** `shell: true` means the in-page
 *   bash interpreter, but a shell path and `detached: true` cannot be honored
 *   in a tab and are rejected.
 * - **`extendEnv` is a request to the interpreter.** just-bash merges `env`
 *   into the interpreter's environment unless asked for `replaceEnv`, so the
 *   adapter asks for it whenever the caller did not set `extendEnv: true`,
 *   which is Effect's replacement default.
