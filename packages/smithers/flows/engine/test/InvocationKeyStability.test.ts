 * Issue #73: invocation keys must not depend on fiber scheduling order.
 *
 * Compensable, irreversible, and unsealed actions are keyed by
 * `(runId, ordinal, tier)`, and the ordinal used to come from one per-run
 * counter bumped in the order fibers happened to reach `actionExecute`.
 * Nothing serializes that order — a flow body may run actions under
 * `Effect.all({ concurrency: "unbounded" })`, and on replay a recorded
 * action resolves from the journal near-instantly while an unrecorded one
 * runs live — so a permuted interleaving aliased one action onto another's
 * recorded attempt rows, checkpoint, and outcome.
 *
 * The two drives below dispatch the same pair of actions in opposite
 * orders, which is exactly what a permuted interleaving produces. Each
 * action must keep its own identity across both.
