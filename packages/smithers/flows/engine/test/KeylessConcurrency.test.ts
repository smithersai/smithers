/**
 * Issue #111: keyless same-declaration actions dispatched concurrently
 * take their ordinals from fiber arrival order, so a crash-resume that
 * replays the fibers in the opposite order silently hands one invocation the
 * other's recorded outcome — with no input material persisted, the swap is
 * undetectable after the fact. Temporal fails such replays with a
 * nondeterminism error; the engine refuses the hazard on the first run
 * instead: a second in-flight keyless dispatch of one allocation scope dies
 * with `ConcurrentKeylessDispatch`. A declared `idempotencyKey` or an
 * interpreter-provided structural site is the sanctioned way to make
 * concurrent invocations distinguishable.
