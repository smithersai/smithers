/**
 * The low-level engine contract a durable store implements. `makeUnsafe`
 * adapts it into the typed `FlowRuntime` port that `@smthrs/flow` declares;
 * stores implement this interface, never the typed port directly.
 *
 * The name is narrower than it looks: only SOME members carry encoded values,
 * and an implementation that encodes the decoded ones produces a silently
 * wrong system, because those members are typed `Flow.Result<unknown, unknown>`
 * and nothing decodes them on the way out.
 *
 * - `actionExecute` and `deferredResult` return ENCODED values, which
 *   `makeUnsafe` decodes through the action's `exitSchemaPartial` and the
 *   deferred's `exitSchema`.
 * - `deferredDone` and `deferredDoneIfWaiting` receive ENCODED exits, which
 *   `makeUnsafe` encodes before the call.
 * - `execute` and `poll` return DECODED results. The implementation decodes
 *   them itself, through
 *   `Flow.Result({ success: flow.successSchema, error: flow.errorSchema })`.
 * - Every other member, optional ones included, carries no flow-declared
 *   payload at all.
 *
 * `docs/reference/engine.md` tabulates every member with its optionality.
