/**
 * Round identity inside a trampoline lineage.
 *
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Trampoline Loops.md` makes every round its own
 * execution, chained under one lineage: the lineage is "the run" a UI, a
 * budget, and time travel attach to, and a round is one fully planned DAG
 * inside it. That leaves exactly one thing to mint, and this module mints it —
 * the next round's execution id.
 *
 * It is DERIVED rather than allocated, from `(rootExecutionId, roundOrdinal)`,
 * through the same injected SHA-256 the rest of the tree derives identity with.
 * That is what makes the handoff at-most-once: a process that dies between
 * settling round N and opening round N+1 re-derives the same id when it comes
 * back, so the re-drive lands on the round that already exists instead of
 * starting a second copy of it. Round 0 is the exception by construction — its
 * id is the one the caller executed, and it is also the root execution id
 * every later round derives from.
 *
 * That root execution id is the TRAMPOLINE lineage. It is branded apart from
 * {@link module:Lineage.JournalLineageId}, the journal lineage, because both
 * are strings and a value from one space is not an address in the other.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
