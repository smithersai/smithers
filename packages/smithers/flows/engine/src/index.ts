/**
 * The runtime that executes `@smthrs/flow` flows.

 * `FlowEngine` implements `FlowRuntime`, the port `@smthrs/flow` declares, on
 * top of a low-level `Encoded` seam that a store implements. This package
 * ships the volatile in-memory implementation of that seam; `@smthrs/engine-store`
 * supplies the durable one. `FlowProxy` derives RPC and HTTP definitions from
 * flow declarations, and `FlowProxyServer` binds those definitions to a
 * running engine.
