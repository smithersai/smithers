/**
 * Server-side layers for flow proxy APIs.
 *
 * `layerHttpApi` connects the HTTP API group created by `FlowProxy` to the
 * supplied flows. `layerRpcHandlers` does the same for the generated RPC
 * definitions. Both layers route execute, discard, and resume requests to the
 * matching flow operation, while the `FlowRuntime` and flow handler
 * services stay on the server side.
 *
 * A handler here calls `flow.execute`, so both layers require what the served
 * bodies require: `Flow.Requirements` of every flow, alongside the schema
 * services `Flow.RequirementsHandler` names. Serving a flow is executing it,
 * and the compile-time gate on a missing action implementation has to hold
 * on this side of an RPC boundary too — the client, which only encodes a
 * payload and decodes a result, still requires nothing of the kind.

/**

 * a multi-tenant server namespaces client identity in one place instead of at
 * every call site.
 *
 * The server calls the function once inside each execute, discard, or resume
 * handler. Execute and discard inputs include the decoded flow payload, while
 * resume inputs use `undefined` because a resume request carries only an
 * execution id. Returning `undefined` for execute or discard lets the engine
 * derive the id from the flow's idempotency key. Returning `undefined` for
 * resume refuses the request with a `Flow.ExecutionIdRequired` defect:
 * falling back to the client value there would let a client resume outside
 * the namespace this option confines it to. Without this option, every
 * client value passes through unchanged.
 *
 * Implementations must be pure, must return for every input, and must return
 * a string for every resume. The function receives the flow and request
 * payload, but no request-scoped service. A resume request carries no
 * payload, so a scope that reads a middleware-authenticated tenant from
 * `payload` has to close over the trusted namespace for resume; a scope built
 * where the tenant is already known covers all three operations.
