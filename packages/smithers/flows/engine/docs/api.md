`@smthrs/engine` exports three namespaces from its root, each also importable
from `@smthrs/engine/<Namespace>`:

| Import                           | Source                                                                                                                             | Platform |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `@smthrs/engine`                 | [src/index.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/flows/engine/src/index.ts)                       | any      |
| `@smthrs/engine/FlowEngine`      | [src/FlowEngine/index.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/flows/engine/src/FlowEngine/index.ts) | any      |
| `@smthrs/engine/FlowProxy`       | [src/FlowProxy.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/flows/engine/src/FlowProxy.ts)               | any      |
| `@smthrs/engine/FlowProxyServer` | [src/FlowProxyServer.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/flows/engine/src/FlowProxyServer.ts)   | any      |

The service tag `FlowRuntime`, the `FlowInstance` service, `annotateWaiting`,
and `FlowCycleDetected` live in [`@smthrs/flow`](/api/flow). What this package
owns is the implementation.

A composition that runs one flow looks like this:

```ts
import { FlowEngine } from "@smthrs/engine"
import { Action, Flow, Interpreter } from "@smthrs/flow"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const Compile = Action.make("example/Compile", {
  payload: { target: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  tier: "sealed"
})

const Build = Flow.make("example/Build", {
  payload: { target: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  body: (payload) => Compile.call(payload)
})

const layer = Layer.mergeAll(
  Compile.toLayer(({ target }) => Effect.succeed(`${target}.js`)),
  Interpreter.layer(Build)
).pipe(Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations), Layer.provideMerge(FlowEngine.layerMemory))
```

For a per-export reference with field-level tables, see the
[Export reference](./reference/engine.md).

## FlowEngine

The runtime. It implements `FlowRuntime` over the `Encoded` seam a store
supplies.

### Layers and constructors

| Export         | Signature                                                                                                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `layerMemory`  | `Layer.Layer<FlowRuntime.FlowRuntime>`                                                                           | The volatile in-memory implementation. Keeps registrations, executions, action settlements, deferred results, and clocks for the life of the layer scope.               |
| `makeUnsafe`   | `(options: Encoded) => FlowRuntime.FlowRuntime["Service"]`                                                       | Adapts a low-level encoded implementation into the typed port. Unsafe in that it trusts the implementation to persist, resume, and encode correctly.                    |
| `makeInstance` | `(flow: Flow.Any, executionId: string) => FlowRuntime.FlowInstance["Service"] & { lineageId: JournalLineageId }` | Builds the per-execution state a runtime hands a flow run: scope, suspension and interruption flags, the run's root journal lineage, and the action coordination state. |

### The encoded seam

`Encoded` is the interface a store implements. The seam is only partly encoded,
and the split is part of the contract:

| Member                                                                | Value crossing the seam                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `actionExecute`, `deferredResult`                                     | Encoded. `makeUnsafe` decodes through the action's `exitSchemaPartial` or the deferred's `exitSchema`. |
| `deferredDone`, `deferredDoneIfWaiting`                               | Encoded. `makeUnsafe` encodes before the call.                                                         |
| `execute`, `poll`                                                     | Decoded `Flow.Result` values, produced by the implementation.                                          |
| `interrupt`, `interruptUnsafe`, `resume`, `scheduleClock`, `register` | No flow-declared payload.                                                                              |

An implementation of `execute` or `poll` decodes on its own, through
`Flow.Result({ success: flow.successSchema, error: flow.errorSchema })`, before
answering. Returning an encoded value from either one produces a silently wrong
system, because the seam types those returns as `Flow.Result<unknown, unknown>`.

The members, in full:

| Member                  | Signature                                                                                                         | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Registrations of one tag stack: the last still-open one serves.                                                                             |

Acknowledges intent, not finished cleanup. Not a pause.                                                                            |

| `resume`                | `(flow, executionId) => Effect<void>`                                                                             | Re-drives a durably suspended execution. Does not undo cancellation.                                                                                                                                                         |

`ActionExecuteOptions` is what an encoded implementation receives for one
dispatch:

| Field              | Type                | Meaning                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`           | `Action.Any`        | The declaration being dispatched.                                               |
| `attempt`          | `number`            | The attempt number, starting at 1. Above 1 marks a retry.                       |
| `key`              | `string`            | The persisted step identity the attempt is recorded under.                      |
| `tier`             | `Action.Tier`       | `"sealed"`, `"compensable"`, or `"irreversible"`.                               |
| `nondeterministic` | `true \| undefined` | Present when a cache put race may retain the first row without failing the run. |
| `metadata`         | `unknown`           | The declaration's metadata, passed through unread.                              |

[The port and the seam](./concepts/port-and-seam.md) explains the design, and
[Implement the Encoded seam](./guides/implement-the-encoded-seam.md) is the
task-shaped walkthrough.

### The snapshot boundary

`SnapshotBoundary` is the host hook compensable actions run inside. This
package declares the service and ships no implementation.

| Member     | Signature                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `snapshot` | `(options: SnapshotBoundaryOptions) => Effect<unknown>`                    |
| `restore`  | `(snapshot: unknown, options: SnapshotBoundaryOptions) => Effect<void>`    |
| `diff`     | `(snapshot: unknown, options: SnapshotBoundaryOptions) => Effect<unknown>` |

`SnapshotBoundaryOptions` carries `flow`, `executionId`, `key`, `attempt`, and
the action's `metadata`. The engine snapshots before each attempt, diffs after
each one, and restores the previous snapshot before a retry. See
[Run a compensable action](./guides/compensable-actions.md).

### Journal lineage

`Lineage` mints the journal address every durable record carries as
`meta.lineageId`: a versioned encoded tuple of the run id and the node path
from the run root.

| Export                     | Signature                             | Meaning                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Lineage.JournalLineageId` | `type JournalLineageId`               | An injective journal address. A branded string. |
| `Lineage.root`             | `(runId: string) => JournalLineageId` | The lineage id of a run's root node.            |

### Trampoline rounds

`Round` carries the trampoline lineage: round zero's execution id, naming the
chain of round executions one `Flow.execute` call follows across handoffs.

| Export                  | Signature                                                                                                                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Round.RootExecutionId` | `type RootExecutionId`                                                                                                              | Round zero's execution id, naming the trampoline lineage. A branded string.                                                                                    |
| `Round.Round`           | `interface Round { rootExecutionId: RootExecutionId; ordinal: number }`                                                             | Where one execution sits in its lineage.                                                                                                                       |

Throws `InvalidRound` on an ill-formed id. A `JournalLineageId` does not compile.       |

Fails when the lineage has spent its budget. An absent budget is unbounded.                                                   |
| `Round.InvalidRound`    | `class InvalidRound`                                                                                                                | A malformed trampoline identity or resource bound. Fields: `code`, `message`.                                                                                  |

The budget counts rounds, so a lineage bounded at `n` may open ordinals 0
through `n - 1`. See [Trampoline rounds](./concepts/trampoline-rounds.md).

All four are `Schema.TaggedError` classes tagged `@smthrs/engine/<Name>`, and
the engine raises them as defects. Their `code` values are
`flow_not_registered`, `execution_identity_conflict`,
`suspended_resume_gave_up`, and `snapshot_boundary_required`.

## FlowProxy

Derives RPC and HTTP definitions from flow declarations. Each flow owns three
wire operations.

| Export               | Signature                                                                                                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                  |

Thrown before construction.                                                                                    |

Thrown before HTTP construction when a tag is not well-formed UTF-16.                                                    |

HTTP routes encode a flow tag as one opaque URL-safe segment, `flow-` followed
by the tag's UTF-16 code units in hex, which preserves case, reserved
characters, Unicode normalization, and operation identity across routers that
disagree about percent-decoding.

## FlowProxyServer

Binds the derived definitions to a running engine.

Both layers drive the served bodies, so both require what those bodies require:
`Flow.Requirements` of every flow, on top of the schema services
`Flow.RequirementsHandler` names. A forgotten `Action.toLayer` is a compile
error on this side of the boundary too. The client side is unaffected: it
encodes a payload and decodes a result, and requires no implementation at all.

Both layers log a defect from a served body through `Effect.logError`,
annotated with the module and the wire operation name.

Returning `undefined` from `ExecutionIdScope` means different things per
operation: for execute and discard it lets the engine derive the id from the
flow's idempotency key; for resume it refuses the request with a
`Flow.ExecutionIdRequired` defect, because passing the client value through would
let a client resume outside the namespace the scope confines it to. See
[Namespace execution ids per tenant](./guides/namespace-execution-ids.md).

These modules expose flow transport only. They do not ship a server, a router,
an authentication policy, or a durable engine.
