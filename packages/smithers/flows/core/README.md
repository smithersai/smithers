# @smthrs/core

Release candidate scope, host requirements and compatibility review are defined in the [library support policy](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/RELEASE_SUPPORT.md).

This package declares `effect` as an exact
`4.0.0-rc.115` peer dependency. Keep the application on that version so
all Smithers packages share one Effect runtime.

**Documentation:** https://core.smithers.sh

Schema-first sugar and metadata over `@smthrs/flow`. `Flow.make` takes one options object and lowers it onto the values that package executes: a declared action a host implements, and the flow that calls it. Beside that it publishes the metadata projections the registry and execution layers read: annotations, effects, placement, key material, digests, and Markdown lowering. The node model is `@smthrs/plan`'s and the graph builder is `@smthrs/flow`'s; `Node` and `Graph` here are the names this package's consumers reach them through.

JavaScript and TypeScript declarations and all planning callbacks must be trusted. `Graph.build` executes flow bodies, `Node.andThen` builders, `Node.catch` recovery callbacks, and an optional `resolveLayers` callback in the caller process with ambient process authority. Purity is a caller obligation, not an enforced boundary. Placement, capability, and effect metadata does not sandbox planning, including sandbox placement, empty capability grants, and sealed effects.

For agent-generated declarations, use a constrained data-only ingestion boundary that trusted code validates and translates into nodes, or load and plan untrusted code in an externally isolated environment with restricted permissions and resources. See [Plan time](https://core.smithers.sh/concepts/plan-time/#planning-requires-trusted-declarations).

```sh
npm install @smthrs/core@next
```

## Public API

The root entry point exports these namespaces; each is also importable from `@smthrs/core/<Module>`.

  output: Schema.String,
  body: ({ name }) => Node.succeed(`Hello, ${name}`)
}).pipe(Flow.within(Placement.sandbox()))

const graph = Graph.build(greeting.flow, { name: "world" })
```

`@smthrs/core/package.json` is also exported. `internal/*` and nested `*/index` subpaths are not public.

## What a signature lowers to

A signature carries one `name`, which is the tag of everything it lowers to.

With a `body`, `Flow.make` returns a value whose `flow` is a `@smthrs/flow` flow with that body: its nodes are the nodes the body returns, and `Graph.build` splices them into the caller's plan.

Without a body, it returns a value that also carries an `action`. The flow's whole body is one call to that action, which is the shape a declared capability ceiling is read off, and the action is what a host attaches the implementation to:

```ts
import { Flow } from "@smthrs/core"
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"

const read = Flow.make({
  name: "std/read",
  input: Schema.Struct({ path: Schema.String }),
  output: Schema.String,
  capabilities: ["fs"]
})

const layer = read.action!.toLayer(({ path }) => Effect.succeed(path))
```

An input schema that is not a struct travels as the one field `input`, because `@smthrs/flow` requires a struct payload. `Flow.Payload<I>` names the wrapped schema, and `signature.call(value)` takes the declared shape and wraps it, so an author never writes the wrapper.

A signature that declares no effect envelope dispatches as `irreversible`. `Flow.sealed` changes its tier to `sealed`, but its generated action remains keyless and uses invocation identity; the tier alone does not enable content sharing across runs. Use the native `Action.make` contract for explicit idempotency keys and implementation versions.

Struct schemas, including `Schema.Class`, pass through as the native payload schema. Calls accept the schema's constructor input, so class schemas accept inert field data without requiring a class instance in a planned payload.

## Identity and caching

`@smthrs/plan` compiles a built graph's digest-free key material into step keys, so two declarations with equal key material are the same step.

An unannotated mapper, continuation, or flow body receives a process-local `sha256-source-ephemeral/v4` identity, because JavaScript cannot inspect closure state: two processes give the same function two different digests. Only `Node.capture` produces the cross-process-stable `sha256-source-captures/v4` identity, by folding the canonicalized inert values a function closes over into its digest. A step whose result must survive a restart has to declare its captures.

```ts
const scaled = Node.capture({ factor: 3 }, (value: number) => value * 3)
```

An authored captured body retains its identity through core lowering and
decorators, including the adapter for a non-struct input. An uncaptured body
remains process-local. Generated action-only wrappers also remain process-local:
use `Interpreter.layer`, or explicitly select `callbackIdentity: "process-local"`
when registering them. A stable composition uses authored captured bodies or
native declarations with explicit capture contracts.

Capture data must be finite, inert, plain data. Accessors, cycles, non-finite numbers, symbols, functions, and non-plain prototypes are rejected rather than hashed incompletely, and accepted capture data is copied and deeply frozen. A function expression reads the copy through its `this` receiver; the returned function keeps its ordinary arguments. Caller objects remain unchanged. Built-in brands and Proxies are refused, and object capture requires `structuredClone`. Captures are compared by structural value: two references to one shared object digest identically to two structurally equal copies, so aliasing is not identity.

## Failure behavior

Construction failures throw; declaration failures are recorded.

`Markdown.parseSkill` enforces the intrinsic rules of the Agent Skills specification: a `name` of 1 to 64 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, or single hyphens that does not start or end with a hyphen, a `description` of 1 to 1024 characters counted in code points, a scalar `allowed-tools`, a scalar `license`, a `compatibility` of 1 to 500 characters, and `metadata` mapping string keys to scalar values. `Markdown.validateSkillFrontmatter` applies the same rules to already-parsed frontmatter. The rule that `name` equals the skill directory name needs the file system and stays with `@smthrs/registry`.

## Mutability

A signature is immutable: every combinator returns a fresh one built from the same declaration, and the original keeps the capabilities, annotations, and collaborators it was made with. A collaborator array handed to `Flow.make` or `Flow.withFlows` is copied, so mutating it afterwards changes nothing.

Plan values are not copied. `Node.succeed`, `Node.fail`, and a call retain the caller's value by reference and read it when the graph is built, so mutating one between construction and `Graph.build` changes the recorded identity.
