/**
 * A WASI preview 1 host shim over a {@link WasiFs.SyncFsLike} slice.
 *
 * This is the syscall layer under the wasm build of jj: the `flows_jj.wasm`
 * reactor imports `wasi_snapshot_preview1`, and this module answers those
 * imports from a synchronous filesystem slice — ZenFS's sync surface in a
 * browser page, `node:fs` in tests. It is written by hand in this repository
 * (the codebase pattern is structural slices passed as arguments, not an npm
 * runtime dependency); `@bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim` is prior art it mirrors in
 * shape, not a dependency.
 *
 * The shim is deliberately testable without any wasm module: {@link make}
 * returns plain functions over `(memory, fs, fd table)` state, so a test can
 * construct a `WebAssembly.Memory`, call the syscalls directly, and assert
 * errno values and memory layouts.
 *
 * One preopen is exposed: fd 3 names `"/"`, mapped to `root` in the slice —
 * exactly what wasi-libc's preopen scan expects, so every absolute path the
 * module opens resolves inside the slice, subject to the namespace ownership
 * requirement below.
 *
 * This shim is not a security sandbox for a concurrently mutated native
 * filesystem. `SyncFsLike` has only path-based calls: no retained directory
 * handles, atomic confined resolution, or no-follow open flags. Checks and
 * subsequent reads or mutations are separate backend calls. The host must
 * prevent other writers (including backend callbacks) from replacing path
 * components during a syscall, including `root` and its host ancestors, or
 * supply a backend that independently confines every operation. Synchronous
 * guest execution alone does not exclude native processes or other workers.
 *
 * The namespace is POSIX: `/` is the only separator, in guest paths and in
 * symlink targets alike, and `root` is expected to be a path the slice joins
 * the same way. A backend that also treats `\` as a separator would read a
 * segment this shim considers an ordinary filename as a traversal, so the
 * confinement below assumes it does not. rc.0 supports no such host: Windows is
 * not a supported runtime, and the slices this ships against are ZenFS and
 * `node:fs` under a POSIX root.
 *
 * **Honest divergences** from a kernel WASI host, in the `BrowserFileSystem`
 * tradition of documenting rather than hiding them:
 *
 * - `fd_sync`/`fd_datasync` only validate the descriptor and report success.
 *   The slice has no flush operation and provides no durability barrier.
 *   The host must await its mount's `sync` for changes that must survive reload.
 * - `poll_oneoff` reports every subscription complete immediately: clock waits
 *   (jj's lock backoff sleeps) become yields, and a synchronous filesystem is
 *   always ready. Nothing can be genuinely waited on in a single thread.
 * - `path_link` is `notsup`: the slice has no `linkSync`, and the jj code paths
 *   this package exercises never hard-link (the contract suite proves it).
 * - `path_filestat_set_times` always follows symlinks: the slice has no
 *   `lutimesSync`.
 * - `fd_readdir` re-lists the directory on each call and uses the entry index
 *   as the cookie, so a directory mutated *between* two reads of the same
 *   iteration can skip or repeat a name — unobservable from the
 *   single-threaded module this shim hosts, which finishes each iteration
 *   before it mutates.
 * - A directory fd names a PATH, not an inode. The slice has no `openat` and no
 *   directory handle to hold, so every use of an open directory fd re-resolves
 *   its namespace path. Rename the directory an fd was opened on and the fd
 *   follows the name, where POSIX would keep naming the moved directory. The
 *   alternative — remembering the host path at open time — is worse than a
 *   divergence: it is an escape, because a symlink left at the old name is then
 *   followed by the backend out of the preopen.
 * - `sock_*` and `proc_raise` are `notsup`; there are no sockets or signals in
 *   a tab.
