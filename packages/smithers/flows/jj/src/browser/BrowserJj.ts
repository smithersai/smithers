/**
 * Browser `Jj` layer.
 *
 * jj is a native binary, but jj-lib compiles to wasm32-wasip1: the
 * `flows_jj.wasm` reactor (built by `crates/flows-jj`, shipped in this
 * package's `wasm/` directory) exposes the six `Jj` contract operations over a
 * tiny JSON ABI, and runs against the {@link WasiPreview1} host shim over the
 * same virtual-filesystem slice `BrowserFileSystem` mounts on. {@link layer}
 * wires the two together.
 *
 * The module is an argument, never a fetch: the page decides how the bytes
 * arrive (bundler asset, `fetch` + `WebAssembly.compileStreaming`, cache), the
 * same way it decides which ZenFS backend is mounted. Likewise persistence is
 * the page's concern — with an async-mirror ZenFS mount, call the mount's
 * `sync` after operations that must survive a reload; this layer does not own
 * the mount.
 *
 * Hosts without a wasm module keep {@link layerUnsupported}: the service stays
 * present and every operation fails `not_installed` in the error channel — an
 * absent capability is a capability with an answer, never a missing tag.
