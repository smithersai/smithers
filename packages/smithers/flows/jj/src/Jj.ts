 * The `Jj` service: version control as a Host capability.
 *
 * Smithers snapshots the working copy around every step, so jj is not a tool the
 * agent happens to call — it is host access, and it goes through a layer like
 * every other. Contract only; module shape follows `effect/FileSystem`.
 *
 * The error lives here rather than in a shared host error module so that a
 * consumer who only snapshots a working copy does not pull in a process
 * spawner or an HTTP client. The one thing this package does import is
 * `@smthrs/capability`, the leaf that names the permission failures a guarded
 * `Jj` adds; it depends on nothing but `effect` either.
 *
 * The tag key and the error `_tag` are durable identity: step keys digest the
 * resolved service set, and `JjError` round-trips through the journal, so
 * renaming either invalidates recorded runs.
