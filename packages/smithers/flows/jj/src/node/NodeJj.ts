/**
 * Node.js `Jj` layer for programs that snapshot and restore workspace state.
 *
 * The exported layers satisfy the platform-independent `Jj` service by shelling
 * out to the `jj` CLI. There are two, and the difference between them is who
 * owns the child process:
 *
 * - {@link layer} spawns through `node:child_process` directly. `jj`
 *   invocations are argv arrays with no shell interpretation, and a host must
 *   be able to checkpoint work even where a spawner is unavailable, sandboxed,
 *   or gated behind a `proc:spawn` grant the user has not given.
 * - {@link layerSpawner} spawns through Effect's `ChildProcessSpawner`, so a
 *   host that decorates that service decorates jj as well. That is what puts a
 *   jj child in its own process group, in `@smthrs/kernel`'s `ProcessLedger`,
 *   and within reach of the reaper that sweeps a crashed incarnation: a
 *   `jj snapshot` that hangs is otherwise a process no host can account for.
 *   `@smthrs/platform-node`'s contained host bundle uses this one.
 *
 * Both await a version probe through their operation runner before exposing
 * `Jj`, sharing its result per absolute executable path and runner. All later
 * operations use that same path, independent of repository cwd or PATH changes.
 *
 * Errors are classified from `jj`'s own stderr vocabulary onto the stable
 * `JjError` codes, the same way `NodeFileSystem` classifies errno, and both
 * layers share that classification.

 * layer starts leads no process group the host recorded, appears in no
 * `ProcessLedger`, and is not reaped by a later incarnation of a host that
 * died holding it.
 *

 * long-lived children of its own: each one writes to a pipe, so jj starts no
 * pager, and no command opens an editor, because `snapshot` either passes
 * `-m` or runs no `describe` at all (`jj describe` without `-m` starts
 * `$JJ_EDITOR` and waits for it, which is exactly the child this bound
 * denies). The invocation holds the handle it started, so cancelling a flow
 * signals the process rather than losing it
 * (`packages/smithers/flows/jj/test/NodeJjLifetime.test.ts`,
 * `packages/smithers/flows/jj/test/NodeJj.test.ts`). A host that wants the process GROUP
 * contained, and a record a crash leaves behind, composes
 * {@link layerSpawner} under a contained spawner instead;
