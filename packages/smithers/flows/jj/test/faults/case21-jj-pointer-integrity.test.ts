/**
 * Case 21 — the pointers a snapshot hands back address the tree it captured.
 *
 * A commit id is the only thing an engine keeps when it snapshots a workspace,
 * so it has to be enough to get the tree back, even after the step that ran
 * next rewrote or abandoned the snapshot's change. This case takes real snapshots
 * of a real Jujutsu repository through `NodeJj`, edits the working copy in
 * between, and restores by id: the file contents that come back are the fact
 * being checked, not the fact that a call returned.
 *
 * The repository is a throwaway created with `jj git init`. `jj` is a first
 * class dependency of the RC, so this case fails rather than skips on CI: a
 * silent skip is how a real regression against the real binary merges.
