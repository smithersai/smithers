 * reads the raw service out of context and returns a guarded one in its place.
 * Permission failures are projected into `PlatformError` by
 * `Permission.toPlatformError`, which keeps the structured kernel failure on
 * the error's `cause`.
 *
 * Governing design:
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Permission Kernel.md`,
