 * contract.

/**
 * The CLOSED LIST of platform ports the kernel protects.
 * Optional filesystem batches belong to the existing FileSystem slot. The
 * decorator grants each member separately and exposes no additional tag or
 * unguarded executor to consumers; host slot identities remain unchanged.
 *
 * Everything that touches the outside world enters Smithers through exactly one
 * of these tags — there is no ambient `node:fs`, no bare `spawn`, no global
 * `Date.now()`. Two things depend on that closure:
 *
 *  1. The capability kernel wraps precisely this list. A service that is not
 *     here cannot be attenuated, denied, or audited, so it must not exist.
 *  2. Step keys digest this list as their `layers` component. Which platform
 *     implementations were in scope is part of a step's identity, so a replay
 *     under different layers is a different step rather than a silent lie.
 *
 * Each slot's guarded implementation replaces the raw one under the same tag,
 * so a consumer that never heard of the kernel still cannot bypass it. Where
 * Effect owns the tag (`FileSystem`, `Path`, `ChildProcessSpawner`,
 * `HttpClient`) the error channel stays Effect's own — `PlatformError`, or
 * `HttpClientError` for the network — and permission failures are projected
 * into it by `Permission.toPlatformError` and `HttpClient.toHttpClientError`;
 * where Smithers owns the service (`Jj`) the interface names the kernel's
 * failures directly.
 *
 * `Path` is intentionally retained as an explicit pass-through decision.
 * Network access is Effect's own `HttpClient`: there is no Smithers transport
 * port beneath it, because a raw port would be a second way to reach the
 * network whose contract never mentions permission.
 *
 * `Clock` and `Random` are Effect core built-ins: already port-shaped, already
 * swappable via `Effect.provideService`, and never decorated here — a `Clock`
 * or a `Random` carries no host authority to guard, so they are not ours to
 * define. `ChildProcessSpawner` is the same story one layer out: process spawning is
 * `effect/unstable/process`, and the slot holds Effect's tag rather than a
 * Smithers wrapper around it.
