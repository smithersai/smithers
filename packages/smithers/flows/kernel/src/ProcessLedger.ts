/**
 * The host's ledger of the processes it spawned.
 *
 * A cancelled run must not leave a child agent running, and the engine cannot
 * do anything about that on its own: cancellation interrupts fibers, and a
 * fiber closing its scope only reaches the processes THIS incarnation of the
 * host still holds a handle for. A host that crashed left its children with no
 * one holding anything.
 *
 * The ledger is the missing half. Every spawn is recorded here in memory and
 * written to the journal as an ownerless durable record. It is ownerless
 * because it describes the host rather than a run, and first-writer-wins is
 * exactly the semantics a spawn record wants. The next incarnation of the same
 * `hostId` replays those records, subtracts the ones that reported an exit,
 * and is left with {@link Service.orphans}: the process groups a dead owner
 * abandoned, which a platform reaper can then signal.
 *
 * The kernel stays BELOW the engine: this module records pids and process
 * groups and knows nothing about runs, attempts, or ownership fences. It also
 * stays platform-neutral, because signalling a process group is a platform
 * concern and lives in `@smthrs/platform-node`.
 *
 * Governing design:
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Host Adapters.md` and
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Journal Queue.md`.
