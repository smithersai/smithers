/**
 * Permission-aware Jujutsu version-control operations.
 *
 * There is no kernel `Jj` interface and no kernel `Jj` tag. `@smthrs/jj` owns
 * both, and its error channel already names the failures the kernel adds, so
 * this module is only the middleware: a `Layer` over the same tag that reads
 * the raw service out of context and returns a guarded one in its place.
 *
 * Governing design:
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Permission Kernel.md`,
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Effect Taxonomy.md`, and
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Host Adapters.md`.
