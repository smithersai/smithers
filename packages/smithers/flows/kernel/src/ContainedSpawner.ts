/**
 * Process containment: prepared ownership, bounded cleanup and durable records.
 *
 * A host supplies a {@link Lifecycle} that owns launch and cleanup independently
 * of the command's exit status. The lifecycle first prepares a process identity;
 * this decorator commits that identity to {@link ProcessLedger.ProcessLedger}
 * before activating the caller's command. Failed or interrupted startup closes
 * its child scope immediately, including any earlier legs of a partial pipeline.
 *
 * Each command receives default termination and escalation options. The host
 * lifecycle validates that policy and verifies cleanup before the decorator
 * retires its record. Unverifiable cleanup retains the record for recovery;
 * a host that dies also leaves its committed records discoverable by the next
 * incarnation's reaper (`ProcessReaper` in `@smthrs/platform-node`).
 *
 * Every pipeline leg is prepared and recorded separately, including legs whose
 * pid the aggregate handle does not expose. The module remains platform-neutral.
 * A layer without a lifecycle provides only deadline defaults and bookkeeping;
 * it does not declare the verified-cleanup contract read by {@link isContained}.
 *
 * Governing design:
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Host Adapters.md`.
