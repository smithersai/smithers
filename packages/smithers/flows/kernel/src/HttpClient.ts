/**
 * Permission-aware outgoing HTTP requests.
 *
 * There is no kernel `HttpClient` interface and no kernel `HttpClient` tag.
 * Effect owns both, and its tag fixes the error channel to `HttpClientError`,
 * so this module is only the middleware: a `Layer` over Effect's own tag that
 * reads the raw client out of context and returns a guarded one in its place.
 * Permission failures are projected into `HttpClientError` by
 * {@link toHttpClientError}, which keeps the structured kernel failure on the
 * transport reason's `cause` so {@link fromHttpClientError} can hand it back.
 *
 * **Redirects.** A redirect is a second network destination, so it needs a
 * second grant check. Two halves guarantee that:
 *
 *  1. The client below this layer must **not** follow redirects on its own.
 *     That is a precondition on the host: Undici without a redirect
 *     interceptor, or Effect's fetch layer with `redirect: "manual"`. This
 *     layer also forces `RequestInit { redirect: "manual" }` over the ambient
 *     value for every request it executes, so a plain `FetchHttpClient.layer`,
 *     which follows redirects by default, cannot walk to another origin below
 *     the guard either. A custom client that ignores `RequestInit` must meet
 *     the precondition itself.
 *  2. This layer composes Effect's own `HttpClient.followRedirects` *above*
 *     the guard. That combinator re-enters `postprocess` for every hop, and
 *     `postprocess` is the guarded one, so hop *n* is checked exactly like hop
 *     zero and an authorized origin cannot lend its grant to another.
 *
 * Governing design:
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Permission Kernel.md`,
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Effect Taxonomy.md`, and
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Host Adapters.md`.
