 * this reference is module-private, {@link attenuate} is its only writer, and
 * `attenuate` composes with the parent rather than replacing it. `none` is the
 * absorbing element of the same operation, so defaulting to it would make the
 * ceiling permanently closed — no exported operation could ever widen a fiber
 * back to any authority at all. A fail-closed ceiling therefore needs a root
 * grant primitive, not a different default.
 *
 * The ceiling is not what makes the kernel fail closed. `GrantStore.check`
 * consults it first and then evaluates the ruleset, whose default verdict is
 * `ask`; an unattended store turns `ask` into `PermissionRequired`. So the
 * composed kernel refuses an ungranted capability on the ruleset, and the
 * ceiling's job is to bound what a *scoped* fiber may ask for.
