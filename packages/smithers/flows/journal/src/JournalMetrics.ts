 * rows read back. No exporter ships in this package; provide one, for
 * example `@smthrs/observability`, and these counters appear in it.

 * **Details**
 *
 * A `durable` emission counts when its receipt is produced, which is after the
 * write transaction returned; under `Journal.transact` that is still inside
 * the caller's transaction, so a receipt that later rolls back with the
 * enclosing transaction has already counted. The counter is throughput
 * evidence, not commit evidence: the journal rows themselves are the latter.
