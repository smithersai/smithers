/**
 * Journal operations.
 *
 * There are two sequence domains:
 *
 * - `seq` is reserved synchronously per run. A lossy reservation is provisional;
 *   the SQL writer moves it above the committed tail if overtaken. The committed
 *   sequence is the canonical order for replay, paging, streams, and projections.
 * - `sourceSeq` is assigned synchronously per `(runId, sourceId)`, or supplied
 *   by the producer, and is the idempotency key for producer retries.
 *
 * Rejected or dropped admissions consume both allocations, so gaps are valid.
 * A retry the in-process index still holds returns `Duplicate` with the
 * original `seq` (provisional while pending) and consumes neither allocation.
 *
 * A retry it no longer holds is admitted optimistically and settled by
 * `UNIQUE (run_id, source_id, source_seq)` at the insert: admission issues no
 * dedup read, so the receipt is `Accepted`, the entry collapses onto the
 * committed row instead of doubling it, and a reused identity carrying
 * different bytes surfaces its `idempotency_conflict` through `flush` rather
 * than through the emit. The read is deliberately absent. `emitLossy` exists
 * to be callable from inside somebody else's open write transaction, and a
 * SELECT there waits on the writer that is waiting on the caller: the agent
 * executor's exit flush deadlocked exactly so. What a producer keeps in
 * exchange is the choice of what a collision means, through `Input.dedupe`.
 *
 * This table is Smithers' logical (domain) write-ahead log and is intended to
 * become the authoritative state history. The storage engine's own WAL
 * underneath it is a durability substrate only and is never consumed as the
 * application event API. A durable boundary must not advance a run or expose
 * its result until its lifecycle entry is committed. No local commit makes a
 * remote effect atomic, so external effects still need idempotency keys,
 * fencing tokens, or compensation.
 *
 * `emitDurable` allocates `seq` inside the writer's SQL transaction, so the
 * returned sequence is already committed and independent writers never fork
 * the per-run clock.
 *
 * Caveat on scope: the stores above this log (`RunStore`, `AttemptStore`,
 * `CacheStore`, and engine-store's `DurableEngineState`) hold the executable
 * authoritative state, and no state is derived from these entries today.
 * `transact` is what keeps the two halves consistent anyway: a state
 * transition and the lifecycle entry describing it are appended in ONE write
 * transaction, so a crash can never leave durable state the journal does not
 * explain (or an entry for a transition that never landed).
 *
 * The surface is split into two channels:
 *
 * - The lifecycle channel, `emitDurable`, returns `DurableReceipt`, so a
 *   dropped lifecycle event is unrepresentable: the write commits, dedupes, or
 *   fails with a typed error.
 * - The lossy channel, `emitLossy`, keeps the optimistic queue and its
 *   overflow policies for telemetry, where `Dropped` receipts and
 *   `drop-oldest` evictions are acceptable.
 *
 * `emitDurable` is fenced on the run's persisted ownership: the caller hands
 * over its `OwnerId`, the durable insert only commits while `flows_runs`
 * still records that owner, and a reclaimed run fails the write with a
 * `fence_lost` error. The fence is mandatory on the lifecycle channel: a
 * lifecycle write is what advances a run, and a zombie owner must not advance
 * anything. The one escape is {@link Service.emitDurableUnfenced}, for the
 * rare admission that is genuinely ownerless.
