/**
 * SQLite-backed logical journal with durable and lossy channels.
 *
 * Lossy telemetry events remain optimistic until the single scoped writer
 * commits them, so a process crash can lose accepted-but-unwritten telemetry.
 * Lifecycle events use `emitDurable` and return after commit, except inside
 * `transact`, where their savepoint completes before the outer commit.
 *
 * Governing design: `packages/smithers/flows/journal/docs/concepts/two-channels.md`.
 * Prior-art decision: `packages/smithers/flows/sync/docs/concepts/replay-then-follow.md`.
 *
 * The replay-then-follow stream follows Effect's `EventJournal` and OpenCode's
 * upstream event stream design. The bounded send queue deliberately deviates
 * from their synchronous durable writes by reserving a provisional per-run
 * sequence before admission. Both channels finalize canonical order at commit.
 * SQLite retry and transaction behavior comes through `@smthrs/database`.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
