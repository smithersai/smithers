/**
 * Durable journal services: the immutable event history and nothing else.
 *
 * Run and attempt state live in `@smthrs/run-store`, sealed step results in
 * `@smthrs/step-cache`, and the durable deferred/clock tables in
 * `@smthrs/engine-store`.
 *
 * This entry point is browser-bundleable: every service here is written
 * against the driver-neutral `@smthrs/database` contract. The test doubles are
 * kept out of it and live under explicit subpaths; of the two, only
 * `TestJournal` binds a Node SQLite database:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Journal, SqlJournal } from "@smthrs/journal"
 * import * as TestJournal from "@smthrs/journal/test/TestJournal"
 * import * as Notifying from "@smthrs/journal/test/Notifying"
 * ```
