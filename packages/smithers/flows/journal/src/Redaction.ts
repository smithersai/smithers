/**
 * Payload redaction for durable journal writes.
 *
 * The journal is permanent and broadly readable: every entry is replayed to
 * sync subscribers and to time-travel consumers. A secret that reaches
 * `payload_json` is therefore not a transient leak, so redaction happens once,
 * on the journal write path, rather than at each reader.
 *
 * Redaction is an **observability** concern and is confined to journal events
 * and export/display surfaces. It is deliberately not applied to executable
 * state, `flows_runs.state_json`, attempt checkpoints, errors, outcomes, and
 * cache results, because those are decoded and re-entered on resume: a
 * placeholder there resumes the flow with the wrong data, and replacing a
 * non-string value with a placeholder string makes the persisted state fail
 * schema decode outright, leaving the run undrivable (issue #72). A value
 * that must never reach durable executable state is a `Redacted` field in the
 * caller's own schema, not a name-suffix guess made at the storage seam.
 *
 * The rule set is a best-effort textual net over credential shapes seen in
 * real bug reports, plus structural redaction by sensitive field name. It is
 * finite, so a value that must never persist belongs in a `Redacted` field of
 * the caller's own schema. See https://journal.smithers.sh/concepts/redaction/
 * for the rule set and how to replace it.

/**
 * Credential names this module refuses to persist, matched as suffixes of the

 *
 * The list is the union of the names `packages/smithers/src/Bug.ts` redacts
 * structurally, because the journal is the PERMANENT side of that pair: a bug
 * report is one upload an operator reviews before it leaves the machine, while
 * `flows_journal_events.payload_json` is replayed verbatim to every sync
 * subscriber and time-travel consumer forever. The journal redacting less than
 * the report inverts the risk, and it did: `credential`, `credentials`, `dsn`,
 * and `connectionString` all round-tripped through a durable row in clear.
 *
 * Two families are spelled out rather than reduced to a shorter word, because
 * these are SUFFIX tests: `connectionString` does not end in `connection`, and
 * `secretKey` does not end in `secret`. A bare `key` suffix is not on the list
 * for the opposite reason: it would redact `monkey` and `turkey`.
 *
 * `signature` stays, and a field it costs is renamed rather than excused. A
 * name test cannot tell a MAC computed with a secret from a digest over public
 * input, and both are called `signature`: `WorkspaceShare` signs its claims
 * with `ShareSigner.signHmac` and that value IS the share's authorization,
 * `GrantStore` carries envelope signatures, and the GitHub, Linear and
 * Telegram webhook readers all verify a header by that name. Against those, a
 * digest whose whole purpose is to be reconciled costs nothing to rename and
 * everything to leave unreadable -- see
 * `AgentEvent.VacuousVerificationObserved.callDigest`, which was `signature`
 * and reached durable rows as the placeholder.
