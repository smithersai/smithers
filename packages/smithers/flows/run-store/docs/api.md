title: "API reference"
description: "Every public export of @smthrs/run-store: the RunStore and AttemptStore services and their outcomes, ownership arbitration, the heartbeat constants, the fencing metrics, the migration set, and the test layer."
---

`@smthrs/run-store` exports five namespaces from its root entry point, and each
is also importable from `@smthrs/run-store/<Module>`:

```ts
import { AttemptStore, Migrations, Ownership, RunStore, RunStoreMetrics } from "@smthrs/run-store"
// or
import * as RunStore from "@smthrs/run-store/RunStore"
```

Two subpaths are not namespaces of the root barrel:
`@smthrs/run-store/Heartbeat`, the lease-constant leaf, and
`@smthrs/run-store/test/TestRunStore`, which binds a Node database.
`@smthrs/run-store/package.json` is exported. `internal/*`, `migrations/*`, and
nested `*/index` are blocked in the export map and are not public API.

Services and tags are Effect constructs: a `Layer` provides a service, and an
effect reads it from context. `RunStore.layer` and `AttemptStore.layer` each
require a `SqlClient` and a `DurableWriter` from
[`@smthrs/database`](/api/database).

## Entry points

The root is driver-neutral and browser-bundleable: nothing under it imports a
`node:` built-in.

## RunStore

One row per durable run: its status, its owner, its heartbeat, its cancellation
intent, and the executable state a resume re-enters.

### RunStore.RunStore

```ts
class RunStore extends Context.Service<RunStore, Service>()("@smthrs/run-store/RunStore")
```

The service tag. The identity string equals the defining module path.

### RunStore.Service

Fourteen operations. Every one validates its input first and fails with
`RunStoreError` on a defect; competition is reported as a success value.

#### create

```ts
const create: (runId: string, stateJson: string, options?: CreateOptions) => Effect<void, RunStoreError>
```

Inserts a `pending` row. `stateJson` is JSON text: it is parsed, bounded, and
stored as the caller's own bytes. `created_at_ms` is stamped from the Effect
`Clock`.

#### get

```ts
const get: (runId: string) => Effect<RunRow, RunStoreError>
```

Reads one row and re-validates it. Fails with `not_found_row` when there is no
such run, and with `decode_failed` when the row breaks the durable invariants.
`latestRound` also reports a missing row as a failure.

#### lineage and latestRound

```ts
const lineage: (runId: string) => Effect<ReadonlyArray<RunRow>, RunStoreError>
const latestRound: (runId: string) => Effect<RunRow, RunStoreError>
```

Resolve trampoline membership from any existing round. `lineage` returns all
rounds in ordinal order, or an empty array for an unknown ID. `latestRound`
returns the highest ordinal using the lineage index, or `not_found_row`.
Pre-lineage roots with null lineage columns are included as round zero. A run
whose own ID equals the lineage ID joins only when its lineage columns are
null or it explicitly names that lineage, so a same-named run in an
independent lineage is excluded.
Fork ancestry in `parentRunId` does not join otherwise independent lineages.
These are individual snapshot reads; compose several reads with the owning
database transaction when they must describe one coherent state.

#### requestCancelLineage

```ts
const requestCancelLineage: (runId: string, nowMs: number) => Effect<RequestCancelOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Records cancellation for every nonterminal round of the named logical run in
one write transaction. A completed predecessor does not hide its live handoff
successor. Existing request times and completed-round history are unchanged.
`CancelRequested` takes precedence if any round gets a new request;
otherwise a previous request yields `AlreadyRequested`. With every round
settled, `Terminal` describes the latest round. An unknown ID yields `NotFound`.
This method does not traverse child ownership edges or interrupt local fibers;
the engine coordinates those operations.

#### requestCancel

```ts
const requestCancel: (runId: string, nowMs: number) => Effect<RequestCancelOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Records unfenced cancellation intent for exactly one round that a later guarded transition observes.
Any observer may call it, and it is first-writer-wins, so a repeat reports the
original time. A settled run records nothing. `nowMs` is request data rather than
a lease predicate, so it is checked as a non-negative safe integer and not bound
by the skew allowance.

#### acknowledgeCancel

```ts
const acknowledgeCancel: (runId: string, owner: OwnerId, nowMs: number) => Effect<boolean, RunStoreError>
```

Records the first owner observation of cancellation intent under the running
owner fence. Returns false when the run is missing, not running, has no intent,
or belongs to another owner. Repeated acknowledgements preserve the original
owner and timestamp. This does not make the run terminal or prove cleanup ended.
Engine snapshots expose the record separately from request and finish.

#### claim

```ts
const claim: (
  runId: string,
  expected: RunSnapshot,
  claimant: OwnerId,
  nowMs: number
) => Effect<ClaimOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Reserves an exact `pending` or `suspended` snapshot for a later `activate`.
`nowMs` becomes `claimed_at_ms` and is the token `activate` compares against.

#### claimAndOwn

```ts
const claimAndOwn: (
  runId: string,
  expected: RunSnapshot,
  owner: OwnerId,
  nowMs: number,
  evidence?: LivenessEvidence
) => Effect<ClaimAndOwnOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Claims and activates in one compare-and-swap. It admits `pending`, `suspended`,
and `running` rows; replacing a different running owner additionally requires
matching evidence, whose `checkedAtMs` must equal `nowMs` exactly. `nowMs` is the
lease cutoff and the first heartbeat.

#### activate

```ts
const activate: (
  runId: string,
  claimant: OwnerId,
  claimedAtMs: number,
  expected: RunSnapshot
) => Effect<ActivateOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Trades a held claim for ownership: sets `status = 'running'`, writes the owner
columns and the first heartbeat from the Effect `Clock`, stamps `started_at_ms`
if it is not already set, and clears the claim. `claimedAtMs` is the fence token
`claim` or `steal` returned.

#### abandonClaim

```ts
const abandonClaim: (
  runId: string,
  claimant: OwnerId,
  claimedAtMs: number
) => Effect<AbandonClaimOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Releases a claim you hold, so a failed activation does not block the next
claimant until the claim goes stale.

#### recoverClaim

```ts
const recoverClaim: (
  runId: string,
  staleClaimant: OwnerId,
  claimedAtMs: number,
  observer: OwnerId,
  nowMs: number,
  evidence: LivenessEvidence
) => Effect<RecoverClaimOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Clears an exact stale claim after matching its claimant and liveness evidence.
The claim must be older than `heartbeatStaleAfter` relative to `nowMs`.
`claimedAtMs` is compared against the row and is not bound by the skew allowance,
because the store issued it.

#### heartbeat

```ts
const heartbeat: (runId: string, owner: OwnerId, nowMs: number) => Effect<HeartbeatOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Renews the owner's lease. The write is `MAX(heartbeat_at_ms, nowMs)`, so a
reading behind the persisted stamp still reports `Updated` without moving the
lease backwards.

#### transitionOwned

```ts
const transitionOwned: (
  runId: string,
  owner: OwnerId,
  toStatus: RunStatus,
  stateJson?: string,
  guard?: TransitionGuard
) => Effect<TransitionOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

The only way to move a run you own. `running` keeps the owner and rewrites only
the state. `suspended` clears the owner, the heartbeat, and the claim and leaves
`finished_at_ms` null. `completed`, `failed`, and `cancelled` clear the same
columns and stamp `finished_at_ms`. `pending` fails with `invalid_run`. An
omitted `stateJson` leaves the column as recorded; a supplied one replaces it
whole. The guard is compiled into the same `UPDATE` as the ownership fence.

#### steal

```ts
const steal: (
  runId: string,
  expected: RunSnapshot,
  claimant: OwnerId,
  nowMs: number,
  evidence: LivenessEvidence
) => Effect<StealOutcome, RunStoreError>
```

Writes the claim columns of a stale `running` row after verifying evidence,
leaving status, owner, and heartbeat untouched so the same `expected` snapshot
activates. The write refuses any row whose `heartbeat_at_ms` is within
`heartbeatStaleAfter` of `nowMs`, and any row that already carries a claim.

### RunStore models

#### RunStatus

```ts
const RunStatus: Schema.Literals<["pending", "running", "suspended", "completed", "failed", "cancelled"]>
type RunStatus = "pending" | "running" | "suspended" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled"
```

#### TerminalRunStatus and isTerminalRunStatus

```ts
const TerminalRunStatus: Schema.Literals<["completed", "failed", "cancelled"]>
type TerminalRunStatus = "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled"
const isTerminalRunStatus: (status: RunStatus) => status is TerminalRunStatus
```

The states a run never leaves. A settled run refuses new cancellation intent and
is never claimed, activated, or swept.

#### RunSnapshot

```ts
interface RunSnapshot {
  readonly status: RunStatus
  readonly owner: OwnerId | null
  readonly heartbeatAtMs: number | null
}
```

The exact triple every claim guards. `running` requires both an owner and a
heartbeat; every other status requires neither. Extra properties are refused as
invalid input.

#### RunRow

```ts
interface RunRow extends RunSnapshot {
  readonly runId: string
  readonly createdAtMs: number
  readonly startedAtMs: number | null
  readonly finishedAtMs: number | null
  readonly claim: OwnerId | null
  readonly claimedAtMs: number | null
  readonly parentRunId: string | null
  readonly cancelRequestedAtMs: number | null
  readonly lineageId?: string | null | undefined
  readonly roundOrdinal?: number | null | undefined
  readonly stateJson: string
}
```

A decoded `flows_runs` row, frozen. `lineageId` and `roundOrdinal` are optional
on the interface because they arrived in an append-only migration, so a
hand-built row still compiles.

#### CreateOptions

```ts
interface CreateOptions {
  readonly parentRunId?: string | undefined
  readonly lineageId?: string | undefined
  readonly roundOrdinal?: number | undefined
}
```

`parentRunId` is the ancestry edge a fork, rewind, child, or trampoline round
carries. It is a column rather than a state field because ancestry is walked in
SQL, and it is a foreign key, so the parent must exist. `lineageId` and
`roundOrdinal` name the trampoline lineage; both absent reads back as round 0 of
a lineage of one.

#### TransitionGuard

```ts
const TransitionGuard: Schema.Struct<{ cancelRequested: Schema.optional<Schema.Literals<["absent", "present"]>> }>
type TransitionGuard = { readonly cancelRequested?: "absent" | "present" }
```

An extra compare-and-swap predicate over first-class run metadata, compiled into
the transition's own `UPDATE`.

### RunStore outcomes

Every tag below is a success value. Union members carrying data are noted.

| Type                   | Tags                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `RequestCancelOutcome` | `CancelRequested { requestedAtMs }`, `AlreadyRequested { requestedAtMs }`, `NotFound`, `Terminal { status }` |
| `ClaimOutcome`         | `Claimed { claimedAtMs }`, `NotFound`, `AlreadyClaimed`, `HeartbeatFresh`, `SnapshotChanged`                 |
| `StealOutcome`         | `ClaimOutcome` plus `LivenessUnconfirmed`                                                                    |
| `ClaimAndOwnOutcome`   | `Activated`, `NotFound`, `AlreadyClaimed`, `HeartbeatFresh`, `SnapshotChanged`, `EvidenceRequired`           |
| `ActivateOutcome`      | `Activated`, `ClaimLost`, `SnapshotChanged`                                                                  |
| `AbandonClaimOutcome`  | `Abandoned`, `ClaimLost`                                                                                     |
| `RecoverClaimOutcome`  | `Recovered`, `NotFound`, `ClaimFresh`, `ClaimChanged`, `LivenessUnconfirmed`                                 |
| `HeartbeatOutcome`     | `Updated`, `FenceLost`, `NotFound`                                                                           |
| `TransitionOutcome`    | `Transitioned`, `FenceLost`, `NotFound`, `GuardFailed`                                                       |

`LivenessUnconfirmed` means the evidence did not match, so no compare-and-swap
ran. `SnapshotChanged` is reserved for matching evidence whose comparison lost to
a row that moved. `EvidenceRequired` means the snapshot is current, its different
owner is stale, and no evidence was supplied: retrying cannot help.
`GuardFailed` means you own the run and the guard refused the write. What to do
about each is in [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).

### RunStore errors

```ts
const RunStoreErrorCode: Schema.Literals<
  ["invalid_run", "not_found_row", "constraint", "decode_failed", "persistence_failed"]
>

class RunStoreError extends Schema.TaggedError<RunStoreError>()("@smthrs/run-store/RunStoreError", {
  code: RunStoreErrorCode
  method: Schema.String
  message: Schema.String
  cause: Schema.Unknown
})
```

`message` is prefixed with the code and the method, as in
`invalid_run: RunStore.claim: run input is invalid`. `cause` carries field names,
lengths, and validity flags, never the value that failed.

### RunStore constants

| Constant              | Value   | Bounds                |
| --------------------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| `maximumRunJsonDepth` | 128     | Executable run state. |
| `maximumRunJsonNodes` | 100,000 | Executable run state. |

Run state has no byte ceiling by design: it is what a resume re-enters, so a
large state has to persist.

### RunStore constructors and layers

```ts
const make: Effect<Service, never, DurableWriter | SqlClient.SqlClient>
const makeNoop: (overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Service
const layer: Layer<RunStore, never, DurableWriter | SqlClient.SqlClient>
const layerNoop: (overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Layer<RunStore>
```

`makeNoop` is an explicit absence: `create` and `get` fail with
`persistence_failed`, and every compare-and-swap reports a loss, `NotFound` or
`ClaimLost` for `activate` and `abandonClaim`.

## AttemptStore

One row per step attempt, addressed by `(runId, stepKeyDigest, attempt)`. Every
write is fenced on the run being `running` under the caller's owner; there is no
unfenced write surface.

### AttemptStore.AttemptStore

```ts
class AttemptStore extends Context.Service<AttemptStore, Service>()("@smthrs/run-store/AttemptStore")
```

### AttemptStore.Service

#### put

```ts
const put: (attempt: Attempt, owner: OwnerId) => Effect<PutResult, AttemptStoreError>
```

Inserts the attempt row. `PutResult` is `Inserted`, `Upserted`, `ExistingSame`,
`Conflict`, `FenceLost`, or `RunNotFound`. `ExistingSame` is a byte-equivalent
replay, which makes a repeated `put` safe; object key order is ignored in that
comparison and array order is not. `Upserted` occurs only under
`putMode: "upsert"` and only while the existing row is still in progress.

#### get

```ts
const get: (id: AttemptId) => Effect<Option<Attempt>, AttemptStoreError>
```

The one unfenced operation. Absent optional columns come back as absent keys
rather than nulls, and every value is re-validated on the way out.

#### heartbeat

```ts
const heartbeat: (
  runId: string,
  stepKeyDigest: string,
  attempt: number,
  owner: OwnerId,
  nowMs: number,
  checkpoint?: JsonValue
) => Effect<HeartbeatResult, AttemptStoreError>
```

Proves the attempt is still moving and optionally saves the value it would resume
from. The checkpoint column is written with `COALESCE`, so omitting the argument
leaves the stored checkpoint alone. The stamp is monotonic. `HeartbeatResult` is
`Updated`, `FenceLost`, `NotFound`, or `StateChanged`, where `StateChanged` means
you own the run but the attempt is no longer in `inProgressStates`.

#### finish

```ts
const finish: (attempt: FinishAttempt, owner: OwnerId) => Effect<FinishResult, AttemptStoreError>
```

Moves the attempt to a terminal state. The target state must not be one of
`inProgressStates`. `FinishResult` is `Finished`, `FenceLost`, `NotFound`, or
`StateChanged`, so a second `finish` never overwrites the winning row.

#### patch

```ts
const patch: (id: AttemptId, patch: AttemptPatch, owner: OwnerId) => Effect<PatchResult, AttemptStoreError>
```

Rewrites the opaque fields without touching the lifecycle, on running and
terminal rows alike. `PatchResult` is `Patched`, `NotFound`, or `FenceLost`. It
is still fenced on run ownership, so a patch after the run settles reports
`FenceLost`.

### AttemptStore models

#### AttemptId, Attempt, FinishAttempt, AttemptPatch

Each is a `Schema.Struct` exported under its own name, with a `type` alias of the
same name for the decoded value:

```ts
interface AttemptId {
  readonly runId: string
  readonly stepKeyDigest: string
  readonly attempt: number
}

interface Attempt extends AttemptId {
  readonly state: string
  readonly startedAtMs: number
  readonly finishedAtMs?: number
  readonly heartbeatAtMs?: number
  readonly checkpoint?: JsonValue
  readonly error?: JsonValue
  readonly outcome?: JsonValue
  readonly meta: JsonValue
}

interface FinishAttempt extends AttemptId {
  readonly state: string
  readonly finishedAtMs: number
  readonly error?: JsonValue
  readonly outcome?: JsonValue
  readonly meta?: JsonValue
}

interface AttemptPatch {
  readonly checkpoint?: JsonValue
  readonly error?: JsonValue
  readonly outcome?: JsonValue
  readonly meta?: JsonValue
}
```

`runId`, `stepKeyDigest`, and `state` are durable text: non-empty, at most 1,024
UTF-16 units, no NUL, no lone surrogate. `attempt` and every timestamp are
non-negative safe integers, range-checked independently and never against each
other, so an attempt whose `finishedAtMs` precedes its `startedAtMs` persists as
written.

`meta` is required on `Attempt` and opaque: its shape belongs to the step
executor, and the store carries it unchanged. On `FinishAttempt` and
`AttemptPatch` an omitted field is left as recorded rather than cleared, so a
terminal transition never erases a value written mid-flight. `AttemptPatch` never
moves `state`, `startedAtMs`, or `finishedAtMs`.

#### JsonValue

```ts
const JsonValue: Schema.declare<Json>
```

The strict JSON value accepted as durable attempt data: plain objects and arrays
of finite numbers, well-formed strings, booleans, and null. Accessors, `toJSON`,
non-plain prototypes, cycles, sparse arrays, enumerable symbols, and ill-formed
text are refused. The store still takes an inert snapshot at effect start; this
schema is the declaration contract the other schemas share.

#### Options

```ts
interface Options {
  readonly inProgressStates?: ReadonlyArray<string> | undefined
  readonly maxCheckpointBytes?: number | undefined
  readonly putMode?: "insert" | "upsert" | undefined
}
```

| Field                | Default       | Meaning                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inProgressStates`   | `["running"]` | The states meaning "still moving". `heartbeat` and `finish` fence on membership.                  |
| `maxCheckpointBytes` | 1 MiB         | Largest encoded checkpoint. Must be between 1 and `maximumCheckpointBytes`.                       |
| `putMode`            | `"insert"`    | `"insert"` is first-writer-wins. `"upsert"` overwrites an in-progress row and reports `Upserted`. |

All three are validated, detached, and frozen when the store is built, so an
invalid policy fails at composition time.

### AttemptStore errors

```ts
const AttemptStoreErrorCode: Schema.Literals<
  ["invalid_attempt", "constraint", "decode_failed", "persistence_failed", "unknown"]
>

class AttemptStoreError extends Schema.TaggedError<AttemptStoreError>()(
  "@smthrs/run-store/AttemptStoreError",
  { code: AttemptStoreErrorCode; method: Schema.String; message: Schema.String; cause?: Schema.Unknown }
)
```

`unknown` is what `layerNoop` reports.

### AttemptStore constants

| Constant                 | Value   | Bounds                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maximumCheckpointBytes` | 16 MiB  | The ceiling `Options.maxCheckpointBytes` may not exceed. |
| `maximumJsonDepth`       | 128     | Every attempt value.                                     |
| `maximumJsonNodes`       | 100,000 | Every attempt value.                                     |

Metadata, errors, and outcomes have no byte ceiling. Only the checkpoint does,
because a step that cannot checkpoint still runs.

### AttemptStore constructors and layers

```ts
const makeWith: (options?: Options) => Effect<Service, AttemptStoreError, DurableWriter | SqlClient.SqlClient>
const make: Effect<Service, never, DurableWriter | SqlClient.SqlClient>
const makeNoop: (overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Service
const layer: Layer<AttemptStore, never, DurableWriter | SqlClient.SqlClient>
const layerWith: (options: Options) => Layer<AttemptStore, AttemptStoreError, DurableWriter | SqlClient.SqlClient>
const layerNoop: (overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Layer<AttemptStore>
```

`make` is `makeWith()` with the defaults, whose validation cannot fail.

## Ownership

Liveness evidence, the checks that produce it, and the heartbeat supervision loop.

### OwnerId

```ts
interface OwnerId {
  readonly hostId: string
  readonly pid: number
  readonly nonce: string
}
```

Defined by [`@smthrs/journal`](/api/journal), because it is the same token the
journal accepts on durable appends, and re-exported here so ownership callers
read one vocabulary. All three fields are compared in the same SQL statement as
every owned mutation.

### LivenessEvidence

```ts
const LivenessEvidence: Schema.Struct<{
  expectedOwner: OwnerId
  checkedAtMs: Schema.Number
  kind: Schema.Literals<["same-host-pid-dead", "cross-host-unreachable-stale", "lease-expired"]>
}>
```

| Kind                           | Accepted when                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `same-host-pid-dead`           | The observer and the recorded owner share a `hostId`.                           |
| `cross-host-unreachable-stale` | The hosts differ.                                                               |
| `lease-expired`                | Any host. The store verifies this claim itself against the persisted heartbeat. |

`checkedAtMs` must equal the consuming call's `nowMs` exactly, so a probe cannot
be replayed into a later decision.

### LivenessProbe, LivenessContext, LivenessCheck

```ts
type LivenessProbe<E = never, R = never> = (
  expectedOwner: OwnerId,
  claimant: OwnerId,
  checkedAtMs: number
) => Effect<LivenessEvidence | undefined, E, R>

interface LivenessContext {
  readonly claimant: OwnerId
  readonly heartbeatAtMs: number | null
  readonly nowMs: number
}

type LivenessCheck = (expectedOwner: OwnerId, context: LivenessContext) => Effect<boolean>
```

A `LivenessCheck` answers "is the recorded owner still working?", and answering
`true` refuses the takeover. A `LivenessProbe` is the evidence factory the store's
evidence-taking operations consume.

### sameHostIncarnation

```ts
const sameHostIncarnation: (expectedOwner: OwnerId, claimant: OwnerId) => boolean
```

Whether two identities are incarnations on the same host. The predicate a probe
applies before it inspects a pid.

### leaseLiveness

```ts
const leaseLiveness: (staleAfter?: Duration.Input) => LivenessCheck
```

The default check and the honest floor: an owner is alive while its persisted
heartbeat is younger than `staleAfter`, which defaults to `heartbeatStaleAfter`.
An owner with no recorded heartbeat is reported gone. Browser compositions keep
it, because a tab has no process table to ask.

### sameHostPidProbe

```ts
const sameHostPidProbe: LivenessCheck
```

Asks this machine's process table with `process.kill(pid, 0)`, which sends no
signal. Only `ESRCH` is read as death; `EPERM`, any other error, and a pid that
is not a positive safe integer are read as life. A recorded owner on another host
is never probed and answers `false`, so the expired lease decides instead of
stranding that host's runs forever. Node hosts only.

### heartbeatLoop

```ts
const heartbeatLoop: (runId: string, owner: OwnerId) => Effect<never, never, RunStore>
```

Pulses every `heartbeatInterval` on the injected `Clock` and interrupts itself
when the fence is gone, so race it against the owned work with
`Effect.raceFirst`. A heartbeat outcome other than `Updated` is durable evidence
and interrupts immediately. An independent deadline bounds failing or stalled
writes by `heartbeatWriteTolerance` and interrupts the pending write at expiry.
Successful pulses re-arm that deadline from the timestamp supplied to the store,
not their completion time.

### The heartbeat constants

`heartbeatInterval`, `heartbeatStaleAfter`, `heartbeatSkewAllowance`, and
`heartbeatWriteTolerance` are re-exported from `Ownership`. See
[Heartbeat](#heartbeat).

## RunStoreMetrics

Metric handles only; `RunStore` updates them as it decides each outcome, and the
counters appear in whatever registry the composition provides.

```ts
const claims: Metric.Metric<number, Metric.CounterState<number>> // "flows_run_claims"
const transitions: Metric.Metric<number, Metric.CounterState<number>> // "flows_run_transitions"
const heartbeats: Metric.Metric<number, Metric.CounterState<number>> // "flows_run_heartbeats"
```

Eight records map an outcome `_tag` to an attributed view of its counter, so an
update or a read is a lookup rather than a branch:

| Record         | Counter       | Keys                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claim`        | `claims`      | `Claimed`, `NotFound`, `AlreadyClaimed`, `HeartbeatFresh`, `SnapshotChanged`                        |
| `claimAndOwn`  | `claims`      | the above with `Activated` for `Claimed`, plus `EvidenceRequired`                                   |
| `activate`     | `claims`      | `Activated`, `ClaimLost`, `SnapshotChanged`                                                         |
| `abandonClaim` | `claims`      | `Abandoned`, `ClaimLost`                                                                            |
| `recoverClaim` | `claims`      | `Recovered`, `NotFound`, `ClaimFresh`, `ClaimChanged`, `LivenessUnconfirmed`                        |
| `steal`        | `claims`      | `Claimed`, `NotFound`, `AlreadyClaimed`, `HeartbeatFresh`, `SnapshotChanged`, `LivenessUnconfirmed` |
| `heartbeat`    | `heartbeats`  | `Updated`, `FenceLost`, `NotFound`                                                                  |
| `transition`   | `transitions` | `Transitioned`, `FenceLost`, `NotFound`, `GuardFailed`                                              |

Each view carries `outcome` in snake case, and the `claims` views also carry `op`
(`claim`, `claim_and_own`, `activate`, `abandon_claim`, `recover_claim`,
`steal`). `RunStore` adds the `to` attribute to a transition at the update site,
because the target status is call input. A terminal transition also advances
`runThroughput` from [`@smthrs/observability`](/api/observability). See
[Observe store outcomes](./guides/observe-outcomes.md).

## Migrations

```ts
const set: DatabaseMigrations.MigrationSet
const run: Effect<ReadonlyArray<readonly [id: number, name: string]>, MigrationError | SqlError, SqlClient.SqlClient>
const layer: Layer<never, MigrationError | SqlError, SqlClient.SqlClient>
```

`set` owns `flows_runs`, `flows_attempts`, `flows_run_source`, and
`flows_run_changes` under the namespace `run-store` and
reserves migration id block 1000, so its ids can never collide with another
package's. Compose `set` with the other storage packages' sets and run them in
one pass rather than layering several migrators;
[`@smthrs/engine-store`](/api/engine-store) already does.

The schema enforces the ownership invariants as SQL `CHECK` constraints, so no
writer, including one issuing raw SQL, can leave a half-owned row behind.

Migration 1003 adds a per-database source identity, monotonic revision triggers,
and cancellation acknowledgement. Every run-row mutation advances the revision
in its transaction. Existing rows receive baseline revisions; earlier mutation
order and acknowledgement are unknown. Deleted run IDs remain permanent
tombstones. See [Execution revisions](./concepts/execution-revisions.md).

## Heartbeat

`@smthrs/run-store/Heartbeat` is a leaf module holding the four lease durations
and the one place they are related. `RunStore` needs the staleness cutoff and
`Ownership` needs all four, and `Ownership` imports `RunStore`, so neither could
own them without the other restating them.

| Constant                  | Value      | What it governs                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `heartbeatInterval`       | 1 second   | How often the supervision loop pulses.                                              |
| `heartbeatStaleAfter`     | 30 seconds | How old a persisted heartbeat must be before a peer may steal the run.              |
| `heartbeatSkewAllowance`  | 10 seconds | How far the owner's wall clock may lag a peer's before the reasoning stops holding. |
| `heartbeatWriteTolerance` | 19 seconds | How long an owner may keep working through failing heartbeat writes.                |

All four are `Duration.Duration`. The last is derived rather than chosen:
`heartbeatStaleAfter - heartbeatSkewAllowance - heartbeatInterval`, so an owner
interrupts itself before a peer may steal the run. See
[The heartbeat lease](./concepts/leases.md).

## TestRunStore

The module exports one layer, which provides both services at once:

```ts
import * as TestRunStore from "@smthrs/run-store/test/TestRunStore"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const tested = program.pipe(Effect.provide(TestRunStore.layer), Effect.scoped)
```

`@smthrs/run-store/test/TestRunStore` provides the production run and attempt
stores over a fresh in-memory SQLite database, with the migrations applied before
either service is exposed. Node only, and scoped: the database closes with the
scope. See [Test against the real stores](./guides/testing.md).
