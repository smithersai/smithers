/**
 * The Node hosts' liveness check: does the owner's process still exist?
 *
 * {@link leaseLiveness} is the honest floor — every host can read a persisted
 * heartbeat — but it is only a timeout, so two engine processes over one
 * database steal each other's running rows `heartbeatStaleAfter` after any
 * heartbeat stall: a stop-the-world pause, a swapped-out process, a disk that
 * blocked longer than the window. This answers the question the lease is
 * standing in for, by asking the operating system whether the recorded pid is
 * still there.
 *
 * `process.kill(pid, 0)` sends no signal; it performs only the delivery
 * checks. Three answers matter:
 *
 * - It returns: the process exists and is signalable. The owner is alive.
 * - It throws `ESRCH`: no such process exists. This is the sole death answer,
 *   so the owner is gone.
 * - It throws anything else, including `EPERM`, `EINVAL`, or an unrecognized
 *   value: the owner is treated as alive because an unknown answer is not
 *   death.
 *
 * This `ESRCH`-only death rule deliberately aligns with
 * `@smthrs/platform-node`'s `HostLiveness`.
 *
 * A pid is only meaningful inside one process namespace, so a recorded owner
 * on another host is never probed: the answer is `false` and the arbitration
 * falls back to the evidence that does cross hosts — the expired lease, which
 * `RunStore.steal` verifies for itself. The engine consults this check only
 * for a run whose lease has ALREADY expired, so answering `false` here does
 * not weaken anything; it declines to add evidence.
 *
 * Node hosts only. It is not part of the browser promise: this entry point
 * bundles for the browser because it never imports a `node:` built-in, and a
 * browser composition has no process table to ask, so it keeps
 * {@link leaseLiveness}.
 *
 * `@smthrs/platform-node`'s `HostLiveness.isAlive` asks the same question of
 * the same process table and differs in one deliberate place: it answers
 * `true` for an owner on another host, which refuses the steal outright, while
 * this check answers `false` and lets the expired lease decide. The difference
 * matters after a host dies for good — under the refusing answer its runs are
 * never reclaimed by anyone, because no other machine can ever produce
 * evidence about its pids.
 *
 * Two limits are inherent to asking a pid, and they bound what reclaim can
 * promise. Both are shared with `HostLiveness.isAlive`.
 *
 * - An owner recorded with the CLAIMANT'S OWN pid is always alive. A previous
 *   incarnation of this process, or a second engine composed inside it, differs
 *   from the claimant only by `nonce`, and the process it names is this one.
 *   Such a row is never stolen while the process lives, so an embedded host
 *   that re-creates its engine in place should keep {@link leaseLiveness},
 *   whose timeout does expire. Reading same-pid-different-nonce as death is
 *   not the alternative: it would let two engines in one process — the exact
 *   shape this check exists to arbitrate — steal each other's live runs.
 * - A pid the operating system has REUSED reports the unrelated process that
 *   now holds it. The dead owner's row stays refused for as long as that
 *   process lives, which delays reclaim rather than breaking it: the row is
 *   still `running` under an expired lease, and the next probe after the pid
 *   is free reclaims it.
