/**
 * Fenced run persistence and ownership compare-and-swap operations.
 *
 * Operations that accept or verify `LivenessEvidence` (`claim`,
 * `claimAndOwn`, `steal`, `heartbeat`, `requestCancel`, and `recoverClaim`)
 * take the caller's `nowMs` and judge it literally, including the lease cutoff
 * and exact `evidence.checkedAtMs === nowMs` rule. The lease operations
 * (`claim`, `claimAndOwn`, `steal`, `heartbeat`, and `recoverClaim`) also
 * refuse a `nowMs` that runs ahead of the injected Effect `Clock` by more than
 * `heartbeatSkewAllowance`: no composition produces one honestly, because the
 * caller and the store share a process, and such a reading is the one lever
 * that steals a fresh owner or pins a lease past the cutoff. A reading behind
 * the clock is admitted, since it only makes staleness judgments more
 * conservative and the monotonic heartbeat absorbs it. `requestCancel` keeps
 * the literal reading because its timestamp is request data, never a lease
 * predicate. Lifecycle stamps use the Effect `Clock`: `create` writes
 * `created_at_ms`, `activate` writes `started_at_ms` and `heartbeat_at_ms`,
 * and `transitionOwned` writes `finished_at_ms`. A row can therefore carry
 * readings from two clocks. Within the allowance the store trusts the caller's
 * clock, which is right for an in-process library over local SQLite and must
 * not cross a trust boundary.
