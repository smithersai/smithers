/**
 * Standard metric definitions for fenced run persistence.
 *
 * This module only defines the metric handles, following the shape of Effect's
 * `ClusterMetrics`. `RunStore` updates them as compare-and-swap outcomes are
 * decided, so every driver that persists through the store — the engine, a
 * sweeper, a foreign process — lands in the same counters. No exporter ships
 * in this package; provide one — for example `@smthrs/observability` —
 * and these counters appear in it.
 *
 * Each exported record maps an outcome's `_tag` to an attributed view of the
 * counter, so an update is a lookup rather than a branch:
 * `Metric.update(RunStoreMetrics.claim[outcome._tag], 1)`.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
