/**
 * The lease is evidence.
 *
 * `steal` used to accept only evidence a caller produced out of band — a pid
 * probe on the owner's host, or an unreachability judgement across hosts — so
 * a process that had nothing but the persisted heartbeat could not reclaim a
 * hard-killed owner at all. The lease itself is the one piece of evidence the
 * store can verify: the steal predicate already refuses any row whose
 * `heartbeat_at_ms` is inside the staleness window, so `lease-expired` evidence
 * is checked by the write that consumes it rather than trusted.
