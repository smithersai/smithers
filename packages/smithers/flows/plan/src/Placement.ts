/**
 * Where a node runs, declared.
 *
 * This is the ONE placement model. `@smthrs/core` re-exports it, `@smthrs/flow`
 * annotates with it, and `@smthrs/registry` lowers a descriptor's frontmatter
 * literal into it. It used to be a typed enum in `@smthrs/core` and an opaque
 * `Schema.Unknown` in `@smthrs/flow`, with a cast in the registry standing
 * between them, so a directive lost its type the moment it crossed a package.
 *
 * It lives here because `KeyMaterial.placement` is the field it ends up in, and
 * `@smthrs/plan` is the lowest package core, flow and the registry all depend
 * on. A placement is serializable detail that identifies a host profile; it
 * never contains a host implementation, credentials, or any other runtime
 * handle.
 *
 * The four tags still read `flows/core/Placement/...`. They are hashed into
 * `KeyMaterial.placement` and therefore into the step key of every node that
 * declares a placement, so retagging them would re-key production work and
 * miss its cached results. The tag is a wire value, not a location.
