/**
 * Pure effect declarations used to describe flow read and write envelopes.
 *
 * This is the ONE effect-envelope model. `@smthrs/flow` enforces it while it
 * builds a graph, `@smthrs/core` re-exports it, and `@smthrs/patterns` reads it
 * to intersect a decorator's declaration with the flow it wraps. It lives here
 * because `@smthrs/plan` is the lowest package all three depend on, beside the
 * `tier` and `onConflict` vocabularies a plan already speaks.
 *
 * Two layers: the declaration API, which a flow author and a catalog use, and
 * the prepared matching API below it, which a graph builder uses to check one
 * envelope against many steps without re-reading the envelope each time.
 *
 * Governing contract: `packages/smithers/flows/plan/docs/api.md`, published as
 * https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/api/plan.

 * The prepared matching API: what a graph builder needs to check one envelope

 * write overlap, which {@link overlaps} wraps for the pairwise case.
 * {@link boundedEffects} snapshots a declaration into builder-owned data,
 * refusing through the caller's own error before the copy grows past its limit,
 * and {@link maximumPathLength} and {@link maximumGlobs} are the per-path bounds
 * that refusal enforces.
