/**
 * The refusals a plan-time build raises instead of producing a wrong plan.
 *
 * Every one of these fails LOUDLY at build time: a planned value that was computed on must not
 * bake `NaN` into a plan, an arm that returned something other than a node must
 * not silently vanish from the topology, and a recursive `.call()` must direct
 * the author to `.to()` or `.child()` rather than expanding forever. Each
 * failure therefore names the site (`node` plus the recorded property `path`)
 * and states the fix in `message`, because the author reading it is mid-body
 * and needs the correction, not a classification.
 *
 * The codes are a closed schema literal so a caller can switch on them, and so
 * a new refusal is a deliberate addition rather than a new free-form string.

/**
 * The stable code of a build refusal.
 *
 * `planned_value_computed` is a body computing on a step result;
 * `invalid_all_member` is a non-node handed to {@link module:Node.all};
 * `invalid_continuation` is a branch arm or continuation that did not return a
 * node; `recursion_requires_boundary` is a flow calling itself inline, which
 * has to become a trampoline handoff or an explicit child boundary;
 * `placement_requires_boundary` is an inline call whose callee declares a
 * placement the enclosing flow cannot satisfy, which has to become that same
 * explicit child boundary; `cyclic_payload` is a payload that contains itself,
 * which no plan could serialize or hash; `payload_too_deep` is a payload
 * nested past the build bound, which has to be flattened into shallower data;
 * `graph_too_deep` is authored topology nested past the build bound, which
 * has to be split with `.child()` boundaries or trampoline handoffs;
 * `duplicate_node` is two structural graph addresses resolving to one durable
 * node id;
 * `invalid_priority` is a scheduling priority that is not a safe integer,
 * which no ordering could compare; `invalid_payload` is a payload member that
 * cannot be captured as inert JSON without executing author code or losing
 * identity; `unstable_callback` is a function with process-local identity in a
 * graph that requires stable callbacks. Declare its complete inert captures
 * with `Node.capture`, including semantic implementation versions. The two
 * depth refusals exist because graph building walks with an explicit stack
 * and refuses at a bound, rather than recursing until the native stack
 * overflows without a typed error.
 *
 * The last four are the effect-authority refusals, raised when a declaration
 * claims more than the declaration enclosing it granted:
 * `effect_outside_envelope` is a read or write path the envelope does not
 * cover, and it names those paths in `path`; `effect_mode_widening` is an
 * `expected` declaration inside a `hermetic` envelope; `effect_tier_widening`
 * is a tier less reversible than the envelope's; and
 * `capability_outside_grant` is a called flow requiring a capability the caller
 * does not hold, which names the dropped capabilities in `path`. The first
 * three are fatal by {@link isFatalDiagnostic}; the fourth is advisory, because
 * dropping a capability narrows authority rather than widening it.
