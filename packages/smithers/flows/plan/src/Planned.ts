/**
 * The placeholder a body sees where a step result will be.
 *
 * A flow body runs at PLAN time, so its
 * own payload is real data while every step result is a value that does not
 * exist yet. That value has a name and one rule: a planned value may be **passed** — into a payload field,
 * into a branch, into a map — and field access is allowed, because it records a
 * reference path. It may never be **computed on**.
 *
 * {@link Planned} is branded, so arithmetic is a compile error.
 * {@link make} returns a strict proxy
 * whose `Symbol.toPrimitive`, `valueOf`, `toString`, `toJSON`, and call traps
 * throw {@link module:GraphBuildError.GraphBuildError} rather than let a plan be
 * built around `NaN` or `"[object Object]"`. The lenient proxy this adapts
 * (`@smthrs/core`'s `Graph.plannedValue`) answered `toPrimitive` with a
 * readable string, which is exactly the silent-wrong-plan path this module
 * exists to close.
 *
 * JavaScript does not expose traps for `Boolean(value)` or strict identity
 * (`value === other`), so those operations cannot be refused at run time.
 * They reveal only proxy truthiness or identity and never the planned result;
 * authors must use {@link module:Node.branch} for decisions on real values.
 * Type-aware ESLint `@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions` rejects
 * planned conditions, but does not reject explicit Boolean coercion or all
 * reference comparisons. Those still require review.
