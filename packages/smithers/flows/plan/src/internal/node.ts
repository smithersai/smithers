/**
 * The node AST, and the side tables the functions hang off.
 *
 * Two invariants shape every declaration here. The AST is **closure-free**
 * and keeps payloads as inert JSON mirrors, so a valid plan can be shipped,
 * stored, diffed, and rendered without the process that built it; control flow is
 * **structure**, so a branch stores both arms as ASTs rather than a function
 * that would have to be run to find out what comes next.
 *
 * The functions an author does write — a mapper, a continuation, a branch
 * predicate — live in `WeakMap`s keyed by the AST node they belong to, and the
 * AST keeps only a {@link FunctionIdentity} digest of their source. The digest
 * is what enters content identity (https://smithers.sh/docs/concepts/content-addressing); the
 * `WeakMap` is what the run reaches for when it has the real value in hand, and
 * it drops with the AST it is keyed by.
 *
 * Adapted from `@smthrs/core` (`packages/smithers/flows/core`)
 * `internal/node.ts`. `Dynamic` does not come across — a model call is an
 * ordinary action here — and neither do annotations, which are `Context`
 * values and would break serializability. Scheduling priority is the one thing that does cross, as
 * the plain JSON field {@link Scheduled.priority} rather than as an
 * annotation, because the scheduler has to read it out of a stored plan.
