 * This is the ONE cache-policy model. `@smthrs/flow` publishes it as
 * `CacheEnvironment.CachePolicy` and the engine reads it off a dispatched
 * action; `@smthrs/patterns` declares it over a flow as `WithCache.Policy`. It
 * used to be two declarations in those two packages, tied together by nothing
 * but a re-typed identifier string, so a field added on one side was invisible
 * to the other. It lives here because `@smthrs/plan` is the package both
 * already depend on.
 *
 * The annotation key still reads `"@smthrs/flow/Action/CachePolicy"`.
 * `@smthrs/engine-store`'s `ActionPersistence` reads the policy off stored and
 * dispatched actions by that identifier, so retagging it would make every
 * policy already written invisible at dispatch. The identifier is a wire
 * value, not a location.
