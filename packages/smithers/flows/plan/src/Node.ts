/**
 * Pure, pipeable nodes: the shape a flow body describes and nothing more.
 *
 * Building a node records an inspectable AST and executes nothing — the same
 * split as Bazel's `ctx.actions.run`, which declares an action rather than
 * running one. A plan is
 * always a DAG, so there is no loop node here and never will be: repetition
 * lives one level up, in what a flow settles with.
 *
 * A node also carries Effect's requirement channel, `R`, and carries it as a
 * PHANTOM: building a plan demands nothing, and every combinator here unions
 * `R` without ever reading it. What fills the channel is a call to something
 * whose code lives elsewhere — an action — so the type of a plan states which
 * implementations executing it will need, and the place that executes it is
 * where the compiler asks for them.
 *
 * Control flow is structure. {@link branch} takes both arms and evaluates each
 * ONCE, symbolically, so the exit condition and the handoff site are visible
 * topology before anything runs; its predicate is digested and runs later on
 * the real value. {@link map} is transformation only. The rule the authoring
 * note states, and this module encodes: **map transforms; branch decides.**
 *
 * Adapted from `@smthrs/core` (`packages/smithers/flows/core`) `Node.ts`.
 * `Dynamic` is gone — a model call is an ordinary action, and nothing
 * model-shaped belongs in this package — and node annotations are gone with
 * it, because the AST has to stay JSON serializable.

 * functions fail closed with process-local identity; use {@link capture} to

 * when handed anything but a function.

 * Declares every semantic value a callback closes over, making its existing
 * source-and-captures identity reproducible across processes.
 *
 * The capture record is canonicalized into function identity and deeply frozen
 * immediately. Unsupported values, accessors, exotic prototypes, symbols,
 * cycles, and member nesting beyond 256 levels are refused instead of
 * producing an identity that cannot describe the function's behavior.
 * Validate application input with its schema before capturing it. This is an
 * author declaration: JavaScript cannot verify closure completeness. Include
 * the version of imported helpers or other implementation behavior that is not
 * present in the callback source. Empty captures are appropriate only when no
 * semantic state exists outside that source. Capturing a snapshot while the
 * callback reads a different mutable object does not make the callback stable.
 *
 * For example, close over the exact frozen record being declared:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const config = { increment: 2, implementationVersion: "counter/v1" }
 * const increment = Node.capture(config, (value: number) => value + config.increment)
 * ```
 *
 * The existing `sha256-source-captures/v4` format is unchanged. Changing source,
 * captures, or an explicitly captured version changes identity; it requires a
 * newly planned run rather than silently re-keying an existing execution.
