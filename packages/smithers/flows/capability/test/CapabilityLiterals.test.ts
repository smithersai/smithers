/**
 * HARDEN-2: every capability literal the repository stages is validated by the
 * real parser and matcher.
 *
 * A capability literal is a security-relevant string that nothing type-checks.
 * It is written into a prompt, a skill, a plugin manifest, an example, a
 * documentation snippet, or a host's own grant rules, and it is read back by
 * `parse` and `matches` at run time. A literal that is misspelled, renamed on
 * one side only, or padded with a stray space neither fails to compile nor
 * fails to load. It simply grants nothing, and the first sign of it is a
 * permission refusal in a run that should have been allowed.
 *
 * That has happened three times here: a `jj:snapshot` grant whose resource
 * still named the pre-rename message, an MCP authority vocabulary the
 * permission boundary rejected, and a `proc:spawn` grant written `" *"`, whose
 * leading space put every real command outside it.
 *
 * This suite reads the staged literals out of the tree and asserts the one
 * thing every grant must do: permit at least one concrete request. It cannot
 * know which request a given grant is meant to allow, so it does not guess. It
 * fails a literal the parser rejects, and a literal that parses but permits
 * nothing.
 *
 * What it therefore does not catch, stated so nobody reads more into a green
 * run: a rename whose new resource still grants something, just not the thing
 * the caller asks for. `jj:snapshot:flows action *` grants `flows action x` and
 * passes here; only a test that knows the message the engine writes can catch
 * that one, and `packages/smithers/flows/engine-store` owns that message.

/**
 * Where a capability literal is staged rather than constructed by a test.
 *
 * Test sources are out of scope on purpose: a test that pins a refusal has to
 * be free to write a literal that grants nothing, which is exactly what this
 * suite fails everywhere else.
 *
 * `apps` is out of scope too, and not by omission. `apps/app` stages its own
 * `capabilities:` vocabulary (`agent`, `local.repositories`, `app:act`,
 * `outbound:launch`), validated by that app's `RepositoryCapabilityPattern`
 * schema and not by this one, so reading it here would fail dozens of strings
 * that are correct where they live. An app's grants are built in code from
 * host values rather than written down, so the app half is a code-level case
 * against the composition, not a corpus walk.
