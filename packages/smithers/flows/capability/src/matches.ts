 * Iterative glob matcher over UTF-16 code units: `*` matches any run of
 * units (path separators and newlines included), `?` matches exactly one
 * unit, and everything else is literal.
 *
 * Grant patterns are attacker-influenced input on the authorization path, so
 * the matcher must not be built on RegExp backtracking: a pattern such as
 * `a*a*a*a*b` against a long non-matching resource made the old
 * `.*`-compiled RegExp exponential. This two-pointer form remembers only the
 * most recent `*` and re-anchors it one unit at a time, which bounds the
 * whole match at O(pattern × resource) with constant memory — the standard
 * linear-scan wildcard algorithm.
