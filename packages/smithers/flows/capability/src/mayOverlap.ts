/**
 * Conservatively determines whether two patterns can select a common

 * that no capability satisfies at once, two literal resources that differ,
 * or literal prefixes that disagree over their shared span. Every
 * relationship the syntactic checks cannot settle, including any run of text
 * behind a `*` or a `?`, answers `true`.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the opposite of `subsumes` and is the point. A
 * caller asks `subsumes` before widening a grant, so an unprovable
 * answer must not grant; a caller asks this before dropping a restriction,
 * so an unprovable answer must keep the restriction alive. Reading "cannot
 * prove coverage" as "does not apply" is how a `deny` rule falls through to
 * a later `allow`.
 *
 * The question is symmetric: `mayOverlap(a, b)` equals `mayOverlap(b, a)`.
