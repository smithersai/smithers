/**
 * Capability values, wildcard policy patterns, and effect-tier
 * classification.
 *
 * This module is the `@smthrs/capability/Capability` barrel. Each public
 * concept is defined in the file of the same name and re-exported here, so
 * `Capability.matches` and `import { matches } from ".../Capability.ts"`
 * keep working unchanged. The `Capability` class itself lives in
 * `ExactCapability.ts`, because a class defined in this barrel would sit in
 * a runtime cycle with the constructors and parsers that instantiate it.
 *
 * Reference: https://capability.smithers.sh/concepts/resource-globs/

 * @since 0.1.0
