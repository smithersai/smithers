 * denial as a hard veto. A configured deny superseded by a later configured
 * allow or ask in that ruleset is therefore not a veto.
 *
 * A rule the matcher cannot decide within `Capability.maxMatchWork` vetoes the
 * decision and `evaluate` returns `deny`. Skipping it could let an undecidable
 * deny fall through to a later allow. The kernel turns that `deny` into a
 * `PermissionDenied`.
