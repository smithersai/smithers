 * RFC 8785 canonical JSON: one document, one byte sequence.
 *
 * Everything `flows` digests goes through here first. A step key, a plan
 * digest, and a cache key are all hashes of JSON, so two structurally equal
 * values must serialize identically or the same work would key differently on
 * two hosts — property order, number formatting, and escaping all have to be
 * pinned, and RFC 8785 is the standard that pins them.
 *
 * The schema is a *decode*, not a formatter: it validates the value is
 * representable (no lone surrogates, no non-finite numbers, no cycles) and
 * fails with a schema issue when it is not, rather than emitting something
 * that would hash.

/**
 * Converts a JSON value into an RFC 8785 canonical JSON document.

 * Decoding fails rather than approximates: a value carrying a lone surrogate,
 * a non-finite number, or a cycle has no canonical form, and emitting a
 * best-effort string for it would produce a digest that silently disagrees
 * with another host's. The refusals live in the serializer itself, so they
 * hold for every string it emits — including one a `toJSON` mints during
 * serialization, which no pre-pass over the input value could ever see.
 * Encoding parses the document back into a plain value. The brand is the
 * guarantee of canonical form: a `Canonical` is only minted by decoding, so
 * the typed encode path never sees malformed text. An unknown-string encode
 * (`encodeUnknownEffect`, `encodeUnknownSync`) can, and a string that does
 * not parse fails with a `canonical_malformed` schema issue in the error
 * channel rather than a raw `SyntaxError`.
