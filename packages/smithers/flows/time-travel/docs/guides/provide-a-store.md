`TimeTravelStore` is the only contract this package defines, and the only
service `TimeTravel.layer` requires that an engine composition does not already
provide. It is the one thing that knows how a run's past is stored: it answers
what the anchors, state, and attempts were at a frame, and it owns the three
mutations time travel performs.

Two implementations satisfy it, and they are behavioural peers rather than a
real one and a lesser one: a run inspected under either must be inspected
identically.

## The durable store

`SqlTimeTravelStore` is the one to run in production:

```ts
import { SqlTimeTravelStore, TimeTravel } from "@smthrs/time-travel"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

const layer = TimeTravel.layer.pipe(Layer.provideMerge(SqlTimeTravelStore.layer))
```

It requires a `SqlClient` and a `DurableWriter` from
[`@smthrs/database`](/api/database). Writes go through the durable writer
rather than straight to the client, so a rewind's audit row, its receipts, and
its truncation land under the same durability discipline as the engine's own
journal writes.

Building the layer applies pending time-travel migration rungs over a database
the journal and run-store ladders have already migrated. Missing
`flows_journal_events` or `flows_runs` fails with a typed `TimeTravelError`
naming the table. Use `Migrations.run` below for a fresh database. The ladder
creates six time-travel tables and initializes the shared journal generations
table:

| Table                            | What it holds                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `flows_time_travel_snapshots`    | The anchors at a frame: the Jujutsu pointer and the plan digest.   |
| `flows_time_travel_edges`        | The fork edges of the lineage tree.                                |
| `flows_time_travel_audits`       | One row per rewind, so a crash leaves something recovery can find. |
| `flows_time_travel_receipts`     | Proof that a side effect was compensated.                          |
| `flows_time_travel_archive`      | The records a truncation moved aside rather than deleted.          |
| `flows_time_travel_fork_intents` | A minted fork id, reserved before its workspace is provisioned.    |
| `flows_journal_generations`      | Journal generation counters, bumped on every truncation.           |

It also indexes `meta_json.lineageId` on the journal's own
`flows_journal_events`, so a lineage-filtered read is not a full run scan.
Two partial indexes on `(run_id, seq)` select child-spawn boundaries and
handoff decisions. Descendant and archive queries probe these indexes for
each reachable parent run. Migration `5003` adds them to existing databases;
building `SqlTimeTravelStore` applies that same recorded rung.

**The store is SQLite dialect only.** Its DDL uses `typeof()` and `json_valid`
CHECK constraints, and its reads use `json_extract` with `$` paths. Any
SQLite-speaking `SqlClient` runs it, whether wa-sqlite, libsql, or the Node or
Bun built-in. PostgreSQL and MySQL are unsupported; a portable dialect would
require a redesign. Archive writes use strict `INSERT` keyed by
`(run_id, generation, seq)`; a collision rolls back the archive transaction.

## Run the migrations on the shared ladder

`Migrations` publishes fixed schema rungs on the shared ladder, recorded in
`flows_migrations`. Building the store applies the same set and skips completed
rungs. A composition can install the complete schema first:

```ts
import { Migrations } from "@smthrs/time-travel"

const migrated = Layer.provideMerge(Migrations.layer, database)
```

`Migrations.set` is time travel's own set at id block `5000`. `Migrations.sets`
is the complete durable schema for an engine with time travel: everything
[`@smthrs/engine-store`](/api/engine-store) composes, then this.
`Migrations.run` applies them in order, and `Migrations.layer` installs them
before exposing the database.

Migration ids are spaced by 1,000. This set ships above the engine's existing
sets and preserves its published rungs: `5001_initial`,
`5002_archive_generation`, `5003_lineage_probes`, and `5004_plan_digest`.
The plan-digest rung accepts columns installed by older store builds outside
the ledger. Future schema changes require new rungs.

## The in-memory store

`MemoryTimeTravelStore` holds everything in JavaScript objects. It is
deterministic, needs no database, and works in the browser, which makes it the
store every test in this package runs against:

```ts
import { MemoryTimeTravelStore, TimeTravel } from "@smthrs/time-travel"

const layer = TimeTravel.layer.pipe(Layer.provideMerge(MemoryTimeTravelStore.layer()))
```

`MemoryTimeTravelStore.make(options)` returns the same store widened with a
`state()` inspector, which is what a test holds when it needs to assert on
archived records or surviving edges. See
[Test against history](./testing.md).

## Write your own

The contract is an ordinary interface. Write the implementation against
`TimeTravelStore.Service`, then pass it through `TimeTravelStore.make`, which
brands it so a new backend is checked at its definition site rather than at the
layer:

```ts
import { TimeTravelStore } from "@smthrs/time-travel"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

declare const implementation: TimeTravelStore.Service

const layer = Layer.succeed(TimeTravelStore.TimeTravelStore)(TimeTravelStore.make(implementation))
```

Hold a new backend to the same answers the two shipped ones give. The reads
reconstruct a frame's past, the audit trio makes an in-flight rewind
recoverable, and `archiveAndTruncate` and `createFork` change the lineage tree.
`recordReceipt` writes one compensation receipt against an open audit row and
touches no lineage. Two behaviours are easy to get wrong and are worth
stating:

- `archiveAndTruncate` is **fenced**. It re-checks the run's recorded owner and
  every non-terminal attached child's exact owner inside the same transaction,
  and refuses the whole mutation with `fence_lost` on a mismatch.
- `nextForkId` **reserves** the id it mints. The reservation is what makes a
  crashed fork retryable under a fresh lane name instead of colliding with the
  leftover on disk.

## Where to go next

- [Installation](../installation.md): the other four services the layer needs.
- [Test against history](./testing.md): seeding a store and asserting on what
  an operation did.
- [API reference](../api.md): every method of `TimeTravelStore.Service`.
