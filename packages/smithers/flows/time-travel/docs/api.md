## Entry points

| Import                                   | Source                                                                                                                                      | Notes                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@smthrs/time-travel`                    | [src/index.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/flows/time-travel/src/index.ts)                           | The barrel is a browser-contract entry point and bundles without a `node:` built-in. |
| `@smthrs/time-travel/SqlTimeTravelStore` | [src/SqlTimeTravelStore.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/flows/time-travel/src/SqlTimeTravelStore.ts) | SQLite dialect only. Any SQLite-speaking `SqlClient` runs it.                        |

The barrel exports `TimeTravel` and `ReadOnlyTimeTravel` flat, and
the other modules as namespaces. It re-exports the rest of the `TimeTravel`
module with them: the types `Position`, `Projection`, `Service`, `Options`,
`ReplayOptions`, `ForkOptions`, `RewindOptions`, `ForkResult` and
`RewindResult`, and the constants `defaultMaxHistoryEntries` and
`forkWorkspaceName`. Every module under `src/` is also published at
`@smthrs/time-travel/<Module>` by the package `exports` map, which is where the
remaining members of the `TimeTravel` module live: `make` and `makeWith` are
reached through
`import * as TimeTravel from "@smthrs/time-travel/TimeTravel"`.

`@smthrs/time-travel/internal/*` is mapped to `null`: `Replay`, `Fork`,
`Rewind`, `Retry`, `Recovery`, `Compensation`, `SnapshotProjector`,
`HistoryLimit`, and `EffectHandlerRegistry` are machinery a caller never names.

## TimeTravel

The one injectable time-travel surface.

```ts
class TimeTravel extends Context.Service<TimeTravel, Service>()("@smthrs/time-travel/TimeTravel")
```

The tag key is durable identity: step keys digest the resolved service set, so
renaming it invalidates recorded runs.

| Export                     | Signature                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TimeTravel.layer`         | `Layer<TimeTravel, TimeTravelError, Requirements>`                                                                       |
| `TimeTravel.layerWith`     | `(options: Options) => Layer<TimeTravel, TimeTravelError, Requirements>`                                                 |
| `TimeTravel.readOnly`      | `Layer<ReadOnlyTimeTravel, never, Journal \| CacheStore>`; inspect/replay without startup recovery or mutation services. |
| `layer`                    | The same value as `TimeTravel.layer`.                                                                                    |
| `layerWith`                | The same function as `TimeTravel.layerWith`.                                                                             |
| `make`                     | `Effect<Service, TimeTravelError, Requirements \| Scope>`                                                                |
| `makeWith`                 | `(options?: Options) => Effect<Service, TimeTravelError, Requirements \| Scope>`                                         |
| `defaultMaxHistoryEntries` | `number`. 100,000.                                                                                                       |
| `forkWorkspaceName`        | `(childRunId: string) => string`. The jj workspace name a fork derives from the child run id it mints.                   |

`Requirements` is `TimeTravelStore | Journal | RunStore | CacheStore | Jj`.
Building the layer is scoped: the scope owns every fork workspace the service
adds by default, so a fork lane is forgotten when the service is released.
Pass `retainWorkspace: true` when a branch must survive that scope, as a CLI-created branch does.
The read-only layer never performs startup recovery; provide read-only persistence beneath it for viewers.

### Position

Where an operation acts: a run, and a frame inside it.

```ts
const Position: Schema.Struct<{ runId: Schema.NonEmptyString; frame: typeof Frame }>
type Position = { readonly runId: string; readonly frame: Frame }
```

### Projection

A pure fold over durable journal evidence.

```ts
interface Projection<S> {
  readonly initial: S
  readonly reduce: (state: S, entry: JournalEvent.Entry, sealed: unknown | undefined) => S
}
```

`sealed` is the recorded result of the sealed step that entry belongs to, when
it has one. Entries arrive by reference; treat them as read-only.

### Service

```ts
interface Service {
  readonly replay: <S>(
    position: Position,
    projection: Projection<S>,
    options?: ReplayOptions
  ) => Effect<S, TimeTravelError>
  readonly inspect: <S>(
    position: Position,
    projection: Projection<S>
  ) => Effect<S, TimeTravelError>
  readonly fork: (position: Position, options?: ForkOptions) => Effect<ForkResult, TimeTravelError>
  readonly rewind: (position: Position, options?: RewindOptions) => Effect<RewindResult, TimeTravelError>
}
```

### Options

How the service is composed.

| Field               | Type                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isAlive`           | `Ownership.LivenessCheck` | Whether the owner recorded on a run is still working, asked before startup recovery takes an interrupted rewind's run over. Defaults to `Ownership.leaseLiveness()` from [`@smthrs/run-store`](/api/run-store). |
| `maxHistoryEntries` | `number`                  | The most journal entries one replay, fork, or rewind may read. Defaults to `defaultMaxHistoryEntries`. Refused `invalid` at build unless it is a positive integer.                                              |

### ReplayOptions, ForkOptions, RewindOptions

```ts
interface ReplayOptions {
  readonly pageSize?: number | undefined
  readonly maxHistoryEntries?: number | undefined
  readonly engineEvents?: EngineEvent.Consumer | undefined
}

interface ForkOptions {
  readonly workspaceRoot?: string | undefined
  readonly retainWorkspace?: boolean | undefined
  readonly maxHistoryEntries?: number | undefined
}

interface RewindOptions {
  readonly detachedChildren?: "block" | "cancel" | undefined
  readonly pageSize?: number | undefined
  readonly maxHistoryEntries?: number | undefined
}
```

`pageSize` is a throughput knob only and never changes a derived answer; it
defaults to 100. In `ReplayOptions` and `RewindOptions`, it must be a safe integer
from 1 through `Journal.maxEntriesLimit` (10,000). Larger pages are refused
with `invalid` before reading the journal. `maxHistoryEntries` overrides
`Options.maxHistoryEntries` for one call. `workspaceRoot` defaults to `.flows/forks` and only moves which lane
the derived workspace name lands in. `retainWorkspace` keeps the child lane
registered after the service scope closes. `detachedChildren` defaults to
`"block"`.

`engineEvents` is the `EngineEvent.Consumer` from `@smthrs/journal` that a
versioned engine record is decoded against: its `runId` and `lineageId` must
equal the position's, and its source allowlist decides which emitters the fold
accepts. A fold that reaches a `flows.engine.v*` entry without a matching
consumer fails `invalid` and derives nothing. `inspect` takes no options, so a
run whose journal carries those records is readable only through `replay`.

### ForkResult and RewindResult

```ts
type ForkResult = TimeTravelStore.Fork

type RewindResult = {
  readonly auditId: string
  readonly frame: Frame
  readonly archive: TimeTravelStore.ArchiveResult
  readonly assessments: ReadonlyArray<Assessment>
  readonly warnings: ReadonlyArray<DetachedChildWarning>
  readonly cancelledChildren: ReadonlyArray<string>
}
```

An `Assessment` carries the crossed `effect` record, its `classification`
(`revertible`, `warning`, or `blocking`), the `reason`, and the operator-facing
`residue`. A `DetachedChildWarning` carries `childRunId`, `parentSeq`, and
`reason`.

## Operations

`TimeTravel` is one injectable service with four operations, each addressed by
a `Position`: a run id plus a `Frame`.

| Operation                                | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replay(position, projection, options?)` | Folds the committed journal prefix up to the frame through a pure projection. It has no dispatcher, so a replay can never re-execute a model call or a child flow, and that is what separates it from an engine resume. The fold streams and stops reading at the frame.                                                                                        |
| `inspect(position, projection)`          | The same fold as `replay`, under the service defaults. It exists for the caller that never tunes a read, and takes no options, so versioned engine history needs `replay` and its `engineEvents`.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `fork(position, options?)`               | Mints and reserves a child run id, provisions the child's Jujutsu workspace pinned at the frame's recorded pointer, then copies the journal prefix, the frame's anchors, and only the attempts that prefix can explain, and records the lineage edge. The parent is never mutated, and the fork refuses `live_parent` while the parent or any ancestor is live. |
| `rewind(position, options?)`             | The fenced, audited suffix-removal protocol. The ownership claim and the audit id are minted inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The workspace a fork lands in is named after the child run id the fork mints,
never supplied: `smithers-fork-` plus the sanitized id capped at 64 characters
plus a short digest of the raw id. A frame forked twice therefore gets two
lanes, and the lane is forgotten when the service scope is released.

The mint is a durable reservation. A process that dies after provisioning the
lane and before the store commits the fork leaves a registered lane and a
reservation behind; the next build of `TimeTravel.layer` forgets the lane of
every reservation older than five minutes whose fork never committed, and the
reserved ordinal is never handed out again, so a retry lands under a fresh
lane name rather than asking Jujutsu for the one the leftover on disk still
holds.

### Rewind order of operations

1. Validate the position, before anything durable exists.
2. Claim and activate the run, then hold the ownership lease with a heartbeat
   for as long as the protocol runs.
3. Re-read the journal tail under the claim; a moved tail is `busy`.
4. Apply the rate limiter and write the audit row with its decision.
5. Read the frame's anchor, the descendants, and the suffix, and assess every
   effect boundary in it.
6. Resolve descendants: a live child refuses the rewind under `"block"`.
7. Compensate the irreversible effects, persisting the accumulated receipts after each
   handler.
8. Restore the Jujutsu workspace to the frame's pointer.
9. Persist the cancellation plan and claim every child it names.
10. Archive and truncate the suffix atomically, fenced on the parent owner and
    every non-terminal attached child's exact owner.
11. Cancel the claimed children, recording each on the audit as it lands.
12. Suspend the run with the state derived at the frame and close the audit.

Step 10 is the recovery commit point. Cancelling a child under
`detachedChildren: "cancel"` happens **after** it, because cancellation is
terminal and has no inverse. Pre-commit child claims are reversible and are
released when the archive fails: an originally suspended child returns to that
status, while a child claimed from pending or dead-running is safely parked
suspended because that is the run store's ownership-clearing reversible state.
The planned cancellations are written to the audit detail before any archive
mutation, so a crash between the commit and the last cancellation is finished
by the next recovery pass rather than silently dropped.

## Recovery

Recovery recognizes child ownership from the persisted rewind or recovery child
nonce. It reclaims expired child leases with fresh liveness evidence and the
run store's snapshot CAS. Claims interrupted before activation are cleared with
`recoverClaim`. Before the archive commits, activated children are released into
`suspended`; after commit, the planned children are cancelled. Live leases or
lost CAS races keep the audit open for retry.

Recovery is not an operation. Building `TimeTravel.layer` finishes or rolls back
every interrupted rewind audit before the service accepts work, so a crashed
rewind never needs a call the caller has to remember.

An audit whose parent or planned child a live process still holds is declined.
It keeps its `in_progress` status and remains in `pendingAudits` for a later
build to retry unresolved work.

`Options.isAlive` is an [`Ownership.LivenessCheck`](/api/run-store) and decides
what "still live" means. It defaults to `Ownership.leaseLiveness()`, the same
check the engine's run driver applies to those rows: an owner is alive while its
persisted heartbeat is younger than `Ownership.heartbeatStaleAfter`. A supplied
check can only refuse a takeover, never widen one, because the evidence recovery
hands `RunStore.steal` is always `lease-expired` and `steal` re-verifies that
claim inside the same write.

```ts
import * as Ownership from "@smthrs/run-store/Ownership"
import { TimeTravel } from "@smthrs/time-travel"

const layer = TimeTravel.layerWith({ isAlive: Ownership.leaseLiveness() })
```

## Frame

The coordinate system. Import as `Frame` from the barrel, or from
`@smthrs/time-travel/Frame`.

| Export                 | Signature                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Frame`                | Schema and type: `{ lineageId: string; seq: number }`. `seq` is a non-negative integer.        |
| `LineageEdgeKind`      | Schema and type: `"child" \| "fork" \| "continuation"`.                                        |
| `LineageEdge`          | Schema and type: `{ parentRunId, parentSeq, childRunId, kind, attached }`.                     |
| `forkCreatedEventType` | `"flows.time-travel.fork-created"`, the journal event type marking a run as fork-created.      |
| `ForkCreated`          | Schema and type: `{ parentRunId, forkJournalOffset, childRunId }`, the payload of that record. |

`seq` counts journal records, so frame `n` means "after the first `n` records
were durable", and `0` is the state before the run wrote anything. `attached`
distinguishes a descendant that still depends on the history under a frame from
one already cut loose.

## TimeTravelError

The single failure type every operation can fail with.

```ts
class TimeTravelError extends Schema.TaggedError<TimeTravelError>()(
  "@smthrs/time-travel/TimeTravelError",
  { code: TimeTravelErrorCode, message: Schema.String, cause: Schema.optional(Schema.Unknown) }
) {}

const error: (code: TimeTravelErrorCode, message: string, cause?: unknown) => TimeTravelError
```

`TimeTravelErrorCode` is a closed literal union of the twelve codes in the
failure table. The tag is wire format and stays fixed even as the code list
grows. `error` omits `cause` entirely when none is supplied, so an absent cause
never encodes as an explicit `undefined`.

## TimeTravelStore

The persistence contract time travel reads history through.

```ts
class TimeTravelStore extends Context.Service<TimeTravelStore, Service>()(
  "@smthrs/time-travel/TimeTravelStore"
) {}

const make: (implementation: Service) => Service
const makeNoop: (overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Service
const layerNoop: (overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Layer<TimeTravelStore>
```

`makeNoop` fails every operation with an `unknown`-coded error except the ones
`overrides` supplies, so a test that stubs two methods gets a named failure the
moment the code under test reaches a third.

### Models

| Export          | Shape                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Snapshot`      | `{ runId, frame, changeId, planDigest? }`. The anchor at a frame. An absent digest means no plan was in force. |
| `AttemptRef`    | `{ stepKeyDigest, attempt }`. An attempt row as `flows_attempts` addresses it.                                 |
| `Descendants`   | `{ attached: LineageEdge[]; detached: LineageEdge[] }`.                                                        |
| `Audit`         | `{ id, runId, frame, status, rateLimit?, detail? }` with `status` of `in_progress`, `completed`, or `failed`.  |
| `AuditPatch`    | `{ status?, rateLimit?, detail? }`. The only keys an open audit row may be advanced through.                   |
| `Receipt`       | `{ id, auditId, effectId, receipt }`. Proof one side effect was compensated.                                   |
| `ArchiveResult` | `{ archived: number; orphaned: LineageEdge[] }`.                                                               |
| `Fork`          | `{ runId, edge, warnings }`. A fork's outcome.                                                                 |
| `ForkIntent`    | `{ childRunId, parentRunId, parentSeq, reservedAtMs }`. A minted fork id whose fork has not committed.         |

Three helpers travel with them:

```ts
const auditPatchKeys: ReadonlyArray<string>
const validateAuditPatch: (patch: AuditPatch) => Effect<AuditPatch, TimeTravelError>
const forkFrameMessage: (parentRunId: string, frame: Frame) => string
```

`validateAuditPatch` refuses a patch carrying a key `AuditPatch` does not admit,
because the offending caller is an untyped one. An invalid status reports
`invalid audit patch: status <json> is not one of in_progress|completed|failed`.
The message omits the patch's detail and handler receipts.
`forkFrameMessage` is the one refusal message both stores raise for a fork whose
frame addresses no record, so a caller that branches on it gets the same answer
from either.

Every method fails as `TimeTravelError`.

## MemoryTimeTravelStore

A `TimeTravelStore` held entirely in JavaScript objects: deterministic, needs
no database, and browser-safe.

```ts
const make: (options?: Options) => TimeTravelStore.Service & { readonly state: () => MemoryState }
const layer: (options?: Options) => Layer<TimeTravelStore.TimeTravelStore>
```

`Options` seeds the world with `records`, `edges`, `snapshots`, `liveRuns`,
`runOwners`, and `runStatuses`, and `failAt` injects an `unknown`-coded failure
at a named internal step so crash-recovery paths are reachable without
crashing. `JournalRecord` is one seeded record: `{ runId, seq, eventId,
lineageId?, payload, eventType? }`. `MemoryState` is the whole world as
`records`, `archived`, `edges`, `audits`, `receipts`, `snapshots`, `liveRuns`,
`runOwners`, `runStatuses`, and `forkIntents`, copied on every read.

## SqlTimeTravelStore

The durable store, SQLite dialect only.

```ts
const migrate: Effect<void, unknown, SqlClient>
const make: Effect<TimeTravelStore.Service, TimeTravelError, DurableWriter | SqlClient>
const layer: Layer<TimeTravelStore.TimeTravelStore, TimeTravelError, DurableWriter | SqlClient>
```

Building `make` applies pending time-travel migration rungs over a database
the journal and run-store ladders have already migrated. Missing
`flows_journal_events` or `flows_runs` fails with a `TimeTravelError` naming
the table. Migration failures also use this typed channel and retain their
cause. Use `Migrations.run` for the complete durable schema on a fresh
database. Writes go through `DurableWriter`.

## EffectBoundary

The producer side: journal an effect so a rewind can assess it.

```ts
const eventType: "flows.time-travel.effect-boundary"

const guard: <A, E, R>(
  description: Description,
  action: Effect<A, E, R>
) => Effect<A, E | TimeTravelError, R | Journal.Journal>

const decodeEntry: (entry: JournalEvent.Entry) => Effect<EffectRecord | undefined, TimeTravelError>
const fromRecords: (records: ReadonlyArray<EffectRecord>) => Effect<ReadonlyArray<EffectRecord>, TimeTravelError>
const fromEntries: (entries: ReadonlyArray<JournalEvent.Entry>) => Effect<ReadonlyArray<EffectRecord>, TimeTravelError>
```

`EffectTier` is `"sealed" | "compensable" | "irreversible"`. `EffectStatus` is
`"intended" | "succeeded" | "unknown"`.

`Description` is what a caller supplies before an action crosses its boundary:
`id`, `kind`, `tier`, `runId`, `lineageId`, `owner`, `sourceId`, `sourceSeq`,
and the optional `input`, `cacheKey`, `changeId`, `idempotencyKey`,
`compensation`, `residue`, `durableBoundary`, `providerStream`, `attempt`,
`nonce`, and `metadata`. `EffectRecord` is the normalized record read back from
the journal, carrying the same identity plus `status`, `seq`, and `output`.

`decodeEntry` answers `undefined` for an entry of another event type, so a
projection over a shared journal stays total, and fails `invalid` for a corrupt
payload under this module's own event type.

## CompensationHandlers

The contribution door for compensation handlers. The registry behind them stays
internal.

```ts
class CompensationHandlers extends Context.Service<CompensationHandlers, ReadonlyArray<Handler>>()(
  "@smthrs/time-travel/CompensationHandlers"
) {}

const layer: (handlers: ReadonlyArray<Handler>) => Layer<CompensationHandlers>
const layerNoop: Layer<CompensationHandlers>
```

The service is optional. A composition with no irreversible adapters provides
nothing, and every crossed effect assesses as blocking, which is the safe
default.

```ts
interface Handler {
  readonly kind: string
  readonly tier: EffectTier
  readonly requiresIdempotencyKey?: boolean | undefined
  readonly compensation?: string | undefined
  readonly residue: (effect: EffectRecord) => string
  readonly assess?: ((effect: EffectRecord) => Effect<Assessment, TimeTravelError>) | undefined
  readonly revert: (effect: EffectRecord) => Effect<unknown, TimeTravelError>
  readonly rollback: (effect: EffectRecord, receipt: unknown) => Effect<void, TimeTravelError>
}
```

`Classification` is `"revertible" | "warning" | "blocking"`. `Assessment` is
`{ classification, reason, residue }`, and a custom `assess` result is decoded
against it before a rewind acts on it: a result that does not decode assesses
as `blocking`.

## Migrations

The schema as fixed rungs on the shared migration ladder. Store construction
uses this same ladder and skips recorded rungs. Published IDs remain stable:
`5001_initial`, `5002_archive_generation`, `5003_lineage_probes`, and
`5004_plan_digest`. The last rung also accepts databases where an older
store build already added `plan_digest` outside the ledger.

| Export  | Signature                                                                                            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `set`   | `DatabaseMigrations.MigrationSet` with namespace `time-travel` at id block `5000`.                   |
| `sets`  | `ReadonlyArray<MigrationSet>`: everything `@smthrs/engine-store` composes, then `set`.               |
| `run`   | `Effect<ReadonlyArray<readonly [id: number, name: string]>, MigrationError \| SqlError, SqlClient>`. |
| `layer` | A layer that installs the complete schema before exposing the database.                              |

The block is above `@smthrs/plan`'s `4000`, which is what keeps the set runnable
on a database the engine ladder already migrated. The journal owns
`flows_journal_events`; this set owns the lineage indexes on that table.

## Failure behaviour

Every operation fails as a `TimeTravelError` discriminated by a closed `code`,
so a caller's branch stays exhaustive.

| Code                  | Raised by              | Means                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `busy`                | `rewind`, recovery     | Another owner holds the run, the journal tail moved under the claim, or this operation lost its claim before it could finish. Retryable.                                                      |
| `live_parent`         | `fork`                 | The parent run, or an ancestor of it, is running, claimed, or owned, so it has no settled prefix to copy.                                                                                     |

| `not_found`           | all verbs              | The run, the frame, or the audit does not address anything: a coordinate past the journal tail, a lineage this run is not on, or a run row that is gone.                                      |
| `invalid`             | all verbs              | A caller-supplied option is malformed, or a durable payload does not decode. Refused before the operation touches anything.                                                                   |
| `already_crossed`     | `EffectBoundary.guard` | The effect already recorded a durable `intended` boundary, so executing it a second time was refused.                                                                                         |
| `rate_limited`        | `rewind`               | The supplied rate limiter rejected the attempt. The audit row records the decision.                                                                                                           |
| `compensation_failed` | `rewind`, recovery     | A rollback handler or the workspace restore failed, so the rewind stopped rather than leave the world half reverted.                                                                          |
| `irreversible`        | `rewind`               | An effect in the truncated range cannot be undone at all: no handler, or a sealed result whose cache entry is gone.                                                                           |
| `fence_lost`          | `rewind`               | The caller's ownership of the run was superseded before a mutation committed, so the mutation was refused rather than written behind the live owner.                                          |
| `limit_exceeded`      | all verbs              | The operation would read more journal entries than `maxHistoryEntries` allows: the prefix a replay folds, the unanchored entries a fork or rewind refreshes, or the suffix it assesses. A rewind refuses before it claims the run. |
| `unknown`             | all verbs              | The store, the journal, or an unmapped host failure. The original cause is attached.                                                                                                          |

An error's `cause` is encoded with the error, so the package never attaches a
whole effect record or a whole parse issue to one: a blocking assessment travels
as its identity, classification, and reason, never as the effect's `input`,
`output`, or residue. Replay scope refusals carry only `runId`, `seq`, `eventId`,
`eventType`, and the expected run and lineage, without journal payload or metadata.

## Limits

- The durable store is SQLite dialect only. Its DDL uses `typeof()` and
  `json_valid` CHECK constraints, and its reads use `json_extract` with `$`
  paths, so any SQLite-speaking `SqlClient` runs it and nothing else does.
  PostgreSQL and PGlite are unsupported. Archive writes use strict `INSERT`
  keyed by `(run_id, generation, seq)`; a collision rolls back the archive
  transaction.
- Journal reads page at 100 entries by default. `pageSize` is a throughput knob
  and never changes a derived answer.
- Every read is capped by `maxHistoryEntries`. The default is 100,000 entries;
  `TimeTravel.layerWith({ maxHistoryEntries })` sets the service default and
  each verb's options override it per call, and a value that is not a positive
  integer is refused `invalid`. A replay streams its fold and stops at the
  frame, so it retains nothing below it; a fork or rewind retains only the
  effect-boundary records of the suffix it assesses. Validation still scans a
  run's journal to its tail to find the frame, without retaining it.
- The anchor refresh a fork or rewind runs before it reads anchors resumes from
  the last anchor per lineage in `flows_time_travel_snapshots` and stops at the
  frame, so it reads only the entries above the run's anchored high-water mark
  and at or below the frame, counted against the same `maxHistoryEntries`. It
  writes each page's anchors in one store write, so a run whose anchors are
  current reads one page and writes nothing. A fork of a live parent is refused
  before the refresh runs. A rewind revalidates the tail under its claim from
  one page at the expected tail, never a second scan of the journal.
- `Projection.reduce` receives store entries by reference. Treat them as
  read-only: mutating one rewrites the evidence the fold is reading.
- The memory store is a behavioural peer of the SQL store for the answers both
  give, not a durable one. It holds everything in JavaScript objects.

## Composition

`TimeTravel.layer` requires `TimeTravelStore`, `Journal`, `RunStore`,
`CacheStore`, and `Jj`, and nothing else. Time travel is a library API, also
exposed as `smthrs runs inspect|replay|fork|rewind`; see the
[CLI reference](https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/cli/). MCP exposes these verbs
only through the unified command tools.

The engine is the producer of everything the service reads.
[`@smthrs/engine-store`](/api/engine-store) stamps `meta.lineageId` on every
record it writes, journals an anchor per attempt, and writes
effect-boundary records around an irreversible dispatch and around a child
spawn. Anchors reach `flows_time_travel_snapshots` through a projection of those
journal records, so the engine never writes this package's tables and the
dependency arrow stays one way.

`SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate` creates `flows_time_travel_snapshots`,
`flows_time_travel_edges`, `flows_time_travel_audits`,
`flows_time_travel_receipts`, `flows_time_travel_archive`, and
`flows_time_travel_fork_intents`. It also initializes `flows_journal_generations`,
the journal generation counters bumped on truncation, and indexes
`meta_json.lineageId` on the journal's own `flows_journal_events` so a
lineage-filtered read is not a full run scan. `Migrations` publishes the fixed
rungs at id block `5000`; store construction applies the same recorded set.

With no `CompensationHandlers` provided, a crossed record that is not sealed
resolves to no handler, classifies as `blocking`, and the rewind fails
`irreversible`. That is the safe default.

A handler is held to what the evidence recorded. An effect that recorded a
`compensation` descriptor resolves only to the handler declaring the same
one, so an adapter swapped in after a restart never compensates evidence
another implementation left behind; an effect that recorded none resolves by
`kind`. A handler with `requiresIdempotencyKey` blocks and never reverts an
effect that recorded no key, a custom `assess` result is decoded against
`Assessment` and assesses `blocking` when it does not decode, and a rollback
refuses a receipt whose tier or descriptor the handler does not match.

After a successful archive transaction, `SqlTimeTravelStore.archiveAndTruncate`
invalidates cached journal identities and allocation floors for the parent and
attached descendants. All live `SqlJournal` instances sharing its SQL client
observe the reset, so archived lossy source identities can be emitted again.
