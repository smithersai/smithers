/**
 * The lineage tree over a REAL trampoline, driven by `@smthrs/engine-store`.
 *
 * `SqlTimeTravelStoreOperations` pins the continuation edge against
 * hand-authored journal rows, which proves the SQL but not the contract: the
 * shape of a handoff decision belongs to the engine, and a projection agreeing
 * with a fixture the same commit wrote agrees with nothing. This suite runs the
 * engine's own trampoline and asks the lineage tree what it sees.
