/**
 * The persistence contract time travel reads history through.
 *
 * `TimeTravelStore` is the only thing that knows how a run's past is stored.
 * It answers the two questions replay cannot answer on its own — what the
 * tier-2 anchors were at a frame, and what state and attempts existed there —
 * and it owns the three mutations time travel performs: writing the audit
 * trail of an in-flight rewind, truncating a run back to a frame, and creating
 * a fork off one. Everything else in the package is a policy layered over this
 * interface.
 *
 * Two implementations satisfy it: `MemoryTimeTravelStore` for tests and
 * browser use, and `SqlTimeTravelStore` for a durable database. They are held
 * to the same behaviour, so a run inspected under one must be inspected
 * identically under the other.
 *
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Time Travel.md` is the governing design.
