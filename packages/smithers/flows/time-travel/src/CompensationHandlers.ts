/**
 * The registration door for compensation handlers.
 *
 * Handlers could arrive through one of two doors: a construction argument on `TimeTravel.layer`, or
 * handlers contributed by the engine composition that owns the effect boundary
 * — either way without re-exposing `EffectHandlerRegistry`, which is machinery
 * and stays under `internal/`.
 *
 * **The pick is the contribution door.** The adapter that performed a tier-3
 * effect owns its compensation (`docs/guides/compensate-an-effect.md`), and the composition that wires that adapter is the only place that can close
 * over the services its `revert` needs. A construction argument on
 * `TimeTravel.layer` would have put that knowledge on whoever assembles the
 * app, one layer away from the boundary it describes. This service is
 * therefore OPTIONAL: a composition with no irreversible adapters provides
 * nothing and every crossed effect still assesses as blocking, which is the
 * pre-existing, safe behaviour.
 *
 * What stays hidden is the registry, not the handler. A caller writes a
 * {@link Handler} and provides {@link layer}; it never sees `HashMap`,
 * `register`, or the immutable-service dance behind them.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { CompensationHandlers } from "@smthrs/time-travel"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
 *
 * const refund = CompensationHandlers.layer([{
 *   kind: "billing/charge",
 *   tier: "irreversible",
 *   residue: (effect) => `Charge ${effect.id} was refunded, not un-charged.`,
 *   revert: (effect) => Effect.succeed({ refunded: effect.id }),
 *   rollback: () => Effect.void
 * }])
 * ```
