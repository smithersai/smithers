/**
 * The durable `TimeTravelStore`, backed by SQL.
 *
 * Six tables carry what the journal cannot: `flows_time_travel_audits`
 * (one row per rewind, so a crash leaves something recovery can find),
 * `flows_time_travel_receipts` (proof a side effect was compensated),
 * `flows_time_travel_snapshots` (the tier-2 anchors at a frame),
 * `flows_time_travel_fork_intents` (a minted fork id, reserved before its
 * workspace is provisioned so a crash between the two never blocks a retry),
 * `flows_time_travel_edges` (fork edges), and `flows_time_travel_archive`
 * (records retained across truncation). The migration ladder also initializes
 * `flows_journal_generations`, shared with the journal.
 * Lineage edges are read as ONE tree across this package's fork edges and the
 * engine's child spawns (`docs/concepts/frames-and-lineage.md`).
 *
 * The derived reads — state and attempts at a frame — are folds over journal
 * records rather than columns, because the run row holds only the *latest*
 * state. The store is SQLite-dialect only: the schema's CHECK constraints use
 * `typeof()` and `json_valid`, and the reads use `json_extract` with `$` paths,
 * none of which Postgres or MySQL parse. Any SQLite-speaking `SqlClient`
 * (wa-sqlite, libsql, node or
 * bun SQLite) runs it; a genuinely generic dialect would have to abstract the
 * JSON functions and the constraint syntax, which is a redesign, not an edit.
