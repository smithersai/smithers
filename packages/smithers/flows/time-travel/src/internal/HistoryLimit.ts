 * A replay folds the prefix below a frame, a fork assesses the suffix above
 * one, and a rewind assesses that suffix while it holds the run. Each used to
 * read to the end of whatever history the journal held, so a long or hostile
 * run decided how much memory a verb took and how long a rewind owned the run.
 * `maxHistoryEntries` caps the entries any one operation reads, and an
 * operation that would cross the cap stops with `limit_exceeded` before it
 * materializes anything past it. The anchor refresh a fork or rewind runs
 * first is under the same cap: it resumes from the run's anchored high-water
 * mark and stops at the frame, so it reads only the entries between the two.
