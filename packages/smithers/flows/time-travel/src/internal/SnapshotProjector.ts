/**
 * The tier-2 anchor projector: engine snapshot records in, frame anchors out.
 *
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Time Travel.md` says a frame must carry the jj pointer
 * current when its seq was journaled and the plan digest in force, because
 * replay cannot derive either. The engine emits both facts as ordinary journal
 * records — it has to, it is the only thing that knows them — but the engine
 * must NOT write `flows_time_travel_snapshots` itself: `@smthrs/time-travel`
 * already depends on `@smthrs/engine-store`, so an engine that wrote this
 * package's tables would close a dependency cycle.
 *
 * A projector is the seam that keeps the arrow one-way. It reads the journal
 * (which both packages may depend on) and folds it into the anchor table
 * through {@link TimeTravelStore.Service.recordSnapshot}. `docs/specs/Concepts/Journal Queue.md`'s
 * rule applies: a projection has no independent durable state, so replaying the
 * same entries reproduces the same anchors, and running it twice is a no-op.
