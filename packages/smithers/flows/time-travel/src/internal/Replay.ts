/**
 * Deriving a run's past state from committed journal evidence alone.
 *
 * This is what makes a frame an address rather than a snapshot: nothing stores
 * "the state at seq 17", so {@link rederive} folds the journal prefix up to a
 * frame through a caller-supplied {@link Projection}. It reads only durable
 * evidence — entries and sealed cache results — and has no dispatcher, so a
 * replay can never re-execute a model call or a child flow. Anything not
 * committed simply is not in the answer.
 *
 * Entries are filtered by lineage, so a run whose journal interleaves several
 * lineages replays exactly the one the frame names.
 *
 * The fold STREAMS. `Journal.entries` hands pages back in sequence order, so
 * each page is folded as it arrives and the read stops at the first record
 * past the frame; nothing below the frame is retained once it has been folded.
 * The prefix used to be collected whole and sorted before the first reduce, so
 * a frame near the head of a long run still paid for the run's whole history.
