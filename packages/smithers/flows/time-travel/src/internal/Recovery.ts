 * returned as typed terminal outcomes and recorded on the same audit row;
 * recovery never invents a run status.
 *
 * An audit whose run another process still holds is reported `Busy` and left
 * untouched, so it is picked up by the next pass rather than closed on the
 * strength of a race. {@link Options.livenessEvidence} is what turns "held by
 * a process that died" back into progress; with none supplied, a run that is
 * still `running` under a foreign owner is always refused.
