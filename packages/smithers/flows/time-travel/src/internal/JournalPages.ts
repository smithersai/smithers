/**
 * The one journal paging loop every time-travel read drives.

 * Replay, the snapshot projector, fork, and both rewind scans page
 * `journal.entries` the same way, and each used to carry its own copy of the
 * cursor bookkeeping and its own idea of what a malformed page means. The
 * copies drifted: the destructive rewind reads refused a page that claims
 * more and delivers nothing, while the fork's copy took it for the end of
 * history and committed a child whose disclosed effects were incomplete.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, once, here. A page that claims `hasMore` and delivers no
 * entries is `invalid`; so is a page whose highest seq does not move the
 * cursor forward, which is the shape a journal double that ignores `after`
 * produces and would otherwise spin forever. A page without `hasMore` ends
 * the read whatever it holds.
