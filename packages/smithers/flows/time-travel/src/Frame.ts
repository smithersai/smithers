/**
 * The coordinate system time travel addresses history with.
 *
 * Every time-travel operation names a point in a run's past as a `Frame` —
 * a lineage plus a journal sequence number — and every operation that creates
 * a new run from that point records a `LineageEdge` back to it. Together they
 * are the whole addressing scheme: a frame says *where*, an edge says *what
 * came from there*, and the two are what `docs/concepts/frames-and-lineage.md`
 * calls the lineage tree.
 *
 * A lineage is not a run. A fork or a continuation starts a new run but may
 * keep walking the same lineage, which is why `Frame` carries `lineageId`
 * rather than `runId`: the run that a frame belongs to is a property of the
 * lineage tree, not of the coordinate.
