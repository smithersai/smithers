/**
 * The one door into time travel: replay, inspect, fork, rewind.
 *
 * `Replay`, `Fork`, `Rewind`, `Recovery`, `Compensation`, and the
 * effect-handler registry are machinery under `src/internal/`; a caller never
 * names them. This service fronts the verbs of
 * `docs/concepts/frames-and-lineage.md` and owns the wiring they used to make
 * the caller thread: the ownership claim a rewind rides, the jj workspace a
 * fork lands in, the compensation-handler registry, the cap on how much
 * history one read may materialize, and startup recovery of an interrupted
 * rewind or fork.
 *
 * Recovery is not an operation. {@link layer} finishes or rolls back every
 * pending rewind audit while it is being built, and forgets the jj lane of
 * every fork that reserved an id and never committed, so the service only
 * ever hands out a store whose interrupted work is already resolved. The one
 * thing it cannot resolve is an audit whose run another live process still
 * holds: that one is declined and left pending for a later build, rather than
 * closed on the strength of a race. {@link Options.isAlive} decides what
 * "still live" means.
 *
 * The tag key `@smthrs/time-travel/TimeTravel` is durable identity: step keys
 * digest the resolved service set, so renaming it invalidates recorded runs.
