/**
 * Why a time-travel operation was refused.
 *
 * `busy`: another rewind holds the run. `live_parent` and `live_child`: the
 * run, an ancestor, or one of its descendants is still executing, so its
 * history is not settled enough to branch from or truncate. `not_found`: the
 * run or frame does not exist. `invalid`: a caller-supplied option is
 * malformed, refused before the operation touches anything. `already_crossed`:
 * the effect already recorded a durable `intended` boundary, so executing it a
 * second time was refused; it is a re-armed effect, never a contended run,
 * which is why it is not `busy`. `rate_limited`: the rewind rate limiter
 * rejected the attempt. `compensation_failed`: a side effect's rollback
 * handler failed, so the rewind stopped rather than leave the world
 * half-reverted. `irreversible`: an effect in the truncated range cannot be
 * undone at all. `fence_lost`: the caller's ownership of the run was
 * superseded before a mutation committed, so the mutation was refused rather
 * than written behind the live owner. `limit_exceeded`: the history the
 * operation would have to read is longer than the configured
 * `maxHistoryEntries`, so it stopped before materializing it. `unknown`: the
 * store or an unmapped host failure.
