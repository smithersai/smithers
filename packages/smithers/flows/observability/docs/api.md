description: "Every public export of @smthrs/observability: the Otlp exporter layers, endpoint and resource validation, the logger layers, the journal forwarder and its durable schema, the runtime metric handles, and the three OpenTelemetry SDK bridges."
---

`@smthrs/observability` exports seven modules from its root entry point, and
each is also importable from `@smthrs/observability/<Module>`:

```ts
import { Endpoint, JournalLogger, Logger, Metric, Otel, Otlp, Resource } from "@smthrs/observability"
// or
import * as Otlp from "@smthrs/observability/Otlp"
```

Two more modules are subpath-only, because each binds a host-specific
OpenTelemetry SDK. `@smthrs/observability/package.json` is exported.

The package is tested with `effect@4.0.0-rc.112`. Layers, services, and schemas
are Effect constructs: a `Layer` provides services, a scoped layer releases on
scope close, and a schema decodes to an `Effect`.

## Otlp

The default exporter. `Otlp` composes `effect/unstable/observability/Otlp` and
nothing else, so it allocates no OpenTelemetry SDK and never resolves a `node:`
built-in. All three signals are JSON-serialized and posted below the configured
base URL at `/v1/logs`, `/v1/metrics`, and `/v1/traces`.

### Otlp.Options

```ts
interface Options {
  readonly baseUrl: string
  readonly serviceName?: string | undefined
  readonly serviceVersion?: string | undefined
  readonly attributes?: Record<string, unknown> | undefined
  readonly headers?: Headers.Input | undefined
  readonly exportInterval?: Duration.Input | undefined
  readonly shutdownTimeout?: Duration.Input | undefined
}
```

- `baseUrl`: the collector base URL, for example `http://localhost:4318`. It
  must be an absolute `http://` or `https://` URL without credentials, query,
  fragment, backslashes, spaces, or controls; anything else fails acquisition with
  `Endpoint.InvalidExporterEndpoint` on path `baseUrl`.
- `serviceName`, `serviceVersion`: the `service.name` and `service.version`
  resource attributes. Default to `defaultServiceName` and
  `defaultServiceVersion`.
- `attributes`: additional resource attributes attached to every exported
  signal, decoded by `Resource.Attributes`.
- `headers`: sent with every export request, which is where vendor
  authentication goes.
- `exportInterval`: the export cadence applied to all three signals. Omitted,
  each signal keeps Effect's own default.
- `shutdownTimeout`: upper bound on the flush performed when the layer's scope
  closes.

### Otlp.layer

```ts
const layer: (options: Options) => Layer.Layer<
  never,
  Resource.InvalidResourceConfiguration | Endpoint.InvalidExporterEndpoint,
  HttpClient.HttpClient
>
```

Installs the OTLP logs, metrics, and traces exporters with the flows resource
defaults filled in. It requires an Effect `HttpClient`, which is how it stays
platform-neutral: a Node host may provide Undici, a browser or a test provides
something else. Both configuration inputs are decoded during acquisition, so
the returned layer either exports or refuses.

### Otlp.layerFetch

```ts
const layerFetch: (options: Options) => Layer.Layer<
  never,
  Resource.InvalidResourceConfiguration | Endpoint.InvalidExporterEndpoint
>
```

`layer` with `FetchHttpClient.layer` already provided, which binds the host's
global `fetch`. This is the default wiring on Node 22 and the only one that is
browser-safe by construction.

```ts
const Telemetry = Otlp.layerFetch({ baseUrl: "http://localhost:4318" })
```

### Otlp.layerNoop

```ts
const layerNoop: Layer.Layer<never>
```

Provides nothing and exports nothing. The explicit stand-in for a host with no
collector, so wiring code switches layers rather than branching.

### Otlp.defaultServiceName

```ts
const defaultServiceName: string // "flows"
```

The `service.name` attribute installed when the caller supplies none.

### Otlp.defaultServiceVersion

```ts
const defaultServiceVersion: string // "1.0.0-rc.0"
```

The `service.version` attribute installed when the caller supplies none. It
mirrors this package's release version, held as a literal because a published
package cannot read its own manifest on every runtime it supports.

### Delivery behavior

Effect's exporter retries a transient failure three times, honoring a
`retry-after` response header when one is present, then disables that exporter
for 60 seconds and logs a `Debug` record. Export failure never fails the
application effect and never surfaces as an unhandled rejection. Closing the
layer's scope performs the final flush, bounded by `shutdownTimeout`.

## Endpoint

Validated collector endpoints, shared by every OTLP builder. The endpoint is
the field an operator most often gets wrong, and a wrong one is invisible after
acquisition, so it is decoded before any exporter exists.

### Endpoint.Endpoint

```ts
const Endpoint: Schema.String.check(...)
```

Runtime schema for an absolute `http:` or `https:` collector endpoint of at
most `maximumEndpointLength` characters that carries no credentials, query,
fragment, backslashes, spaces, or controls. A base path is allowed;
authentication belongs in exporter headers. Query and fragment suffixes are
rejected because appending `/v1/traces` to them does not change the request
path. A value the WHATWG URL parser would repair rather
than parse as written is refused, because the repaired URL is not the one the
exporter would post to.

### Endpoint.maximumEndpointLength

```ts
const maximumEndpointLength: number // 2048
```

Largest collector endpoint accepted by a builder.

### Endpoint.decode

```ts
const decode: (endpoint: unknown, path: string) => Effect.Effect<string, InvalidExporterEndpoint>
```

Decodes one endpoint into its normalized form. `path` names the option the
endpoint arrived on, so the refusal points at the caller's own field rather
than at a shared internal name. The rejected value is not retained in the
error.

### Endpoint.InvalidExporterEndpoint

```ts
class InvalidExporterEndpoint {
  readonly code: "invalid_exporter_endpoint"
  readonly path: string
  readonly message: string
}
```

The stable exporter-endpoint refusal shared by `Otlp.layer`,
`Otlp.layerFetch` (`path` is `baseUrl`), and `NodeOtel.layerOtel` (`path` is
`endpoint`).

### Endpoint.normalize

```ts
const normalize: (endpoint: string) => string
```

Removes repeated trailing separators, so `http://host//` and `http://host` both
produce one signal URL.

### Endpoint.signalUrl

```ts
const signalUrl: (endpoint: string, signal: "traces" | "metrics" | "logs") => string
```

Builds the OTLP/HTTP URL one signal is posted to below a decoded endpoint:
`signalUrl("http://host", "traces")` is `http://host/v1/traces`.

## Resource

Explicit, validated OpenTelemetry resource metadata. Every public OTEL builder
in this package decodes the same `Configuration`, and no builder reads an
environment variable: every attribute is one the caller passed.

### Resource.Configuration

```ts
const Configuration: Schema.Struct<{
  serviceName: Schema.String
  serviceVersion: Schema.optional<Schema.String>
  attributes: Schema.optional<typeof Attributes>
}>
type Configuration = typeof Configuration.Type
```

The service identity attached to exported telemetry. `serviceName` and
`serviceVersion` are non-empty, well formed, and at most
`maximumIdentityLength` UTF-16 code units.

### Resource.Attributes and Resource.AttributeValue

```ts
const AttributeValue: Schema.Union<[...]>
const Attributes: Schema.Record<Schema.String, typeof AttributeValue>
```

`AttributeValue` accepts a string of at most `maximumAttributeStringLength`
code units, a finite number, a boolean, or a homogeneous array of one of those
scalar types. `Attributes` bounds the record at `maximumAttributes` entries
with non-empty, well formed keys of at most `maximumAttributeKeyLength` code
units. NUL and unpaired UTF-16 surrogates are refused in keys and in values;
valid astral Unicode is preserved.

### Resource constants

```ts
const maximumIdentityLength: number // 1024
const maximumAttributeKeyLength: number // 1024
const maximumAttributeStringLength: number // 65536
const maximumAttributes: number // 256
```

### Resource.decode

```ts
const decode: (configuration: unknown) => Effect.Effect<Configuration, InvalidResourceConfiguration>
```

Decodes one resource configuration without retaining rejected values.

### Resource.decodeSync

```ts
const decodeSync: (configuration: unknown) => Configuration
```

The same decoding for the package's pure projection API. Throws
`InvalidResourceConfiguration` rather than failing an effect.

### Resource.InvalidResourceConfiguration

```ts
class InvalidResourceConfiguration {
  readonly code: "invalid_resource_configuration"
  readonly path: string
  readonly message: string
}
```

The stable resource refusal shared by every layer here. `path` is a dotted
route into the offending field, such as `serviceName` or `attributes.region`,
and is the bare `resource` when the whole configuration was malformed.

### Resource.toOpenTelemetryConfiguration

```ts
const toOpenTelemetryConfiguration: (configuration: Configuration) => {
  readonly serviceName: string
  readonly serviceVersion?: string
  readonly attributes?: Attributes
}
```

Projects a decoded resource into the exact optional-property shape the
OpenTelemetry SDK expects, omitting absent optional fields rather than setting
them to `undefined`.

### Resource.configToAttributes

```ts
const configToAttributes: (configuration: Configuration) => Attributes
```

Converts explicit service metadata into OpenTelemetry resource attributes.
Invalid metadata throws the same typed `InvalidResourceConfiguration` a layer
returns during acquisition.

### Resource.layer

```ts
const layer: (configuration: Configuration) => Layer.Layer<Resource, InvalidResourceConfiguration>
```

Provides an explicitly validated OpenTelemetry resource, for a composition that
assembles the rest of the SDK itself.

### Resource.Resource

The OpenTelemetry resource service tag, re-exported from
`@effect/opentelemetry/Resource`.

## Logger

Effect logger layers. All four follow two rules: `mergeWithExisting` defaults
to `false`, so installing one replaces the ambient logger set, and
`minimumLogLevel` is applied only when the caller names it.

### Logger.Options

```ts
interface Options {
  readonly minimumLogLevel?: LogLevel.LogLevel | undefined
  readonly mergeWithExisting?: boolean | undefined
}
```

- `minimumLogLevel`: pins `References.MinimumLogLevel` for the whole
  application. Omitted, the layer leaves that reference alone and Effect's own
  `Info` default applies.
- `mergeWithExisting`: keeps the ambient loggers alongside this one. Defaults
  to `false`.

### Logger.layerPrettyDev

```ts
const layerPrettyDev: (options?: Options) => Layer.Layer<never>
```

A human-readable development logger, with colors and mode chosen from the
output it finds.

### Logger.layerStructuredJson

```ts
const layerStructuredJson: (options?: Options) => Layer.Layer<never>
```

One structured JSON object per log line.

### Logger.layerNoop

```ts
const layerNoop: (options?: Pick<Options, "minimumLogLevel">) => Layer.Layer<never>
```

Removes the active logger set. This is the one exception to the second rule:
silencing is its purpose, so it pins `None` unless the caller names another
level.

### Logger.layer

```ts
const layer: (logger: Logger.Logger<unknown, unknown>, options?: Options) => Layer.Layer<never>
```

Installs a caller-supplied logger under the same two rules.

## JournalLogger

Non-blocking forwarding of bounded operational logs to the durable journal. The
callback reads the queue's remaining room, snapshots and redacts a bounded
record synchronously only when a slot is free, then performs only queue
admission; a forked worker drains the queue into the journal. A record a full
queue cannot take is counted and discarded without being snapshotted.

### JournalLogger.Options

```ts
interface Options {
  readonly runId: JournalEvent.RunId
  readonly capacity?: number | undefined
  readonly minimumLogLevel?: LogLevel.LogLevel | undefined
  readonly mergeWithExisting?: boolean | undefined
}
```

- `runId`: the run every forwarded record is attributed to.
- `capacity`: queue depth, 1 through `maximumCapacity`. Defaults to 256.
- `minimumLogLevel` and `mergeWithExisting`: as on `Logger.Options`.

### JournalLogger.layerJournalForwarding

```ts
const layerJournalForwarding: (
  options: Options
) => Layer.Layer<never, InvalidJournalLoggerOptions, Journal.Journal>
```

Installs a bounded, drop-on-overflow forwarder for one explicit run.
Configuration is decoded before a worker starts, so an invalid run id or
capacity fails acquisition rather than being routed through the lossy worker.

Each record becomes one journal entry on the lossy channel, with `eventType`
`telemetry.log`, source `flows/observability/logger`, and a `TelemetryLog`
payload. The durable journal allocates the per-source sequence, so a rebuilt or
concurrently running layer for one run cannot reuse an identity.

Overflow, journal delivery failures, and journal defects are telemetry losses
rather than application failures. Each advances `Metric.droppedLogRecords`; the
two failure paths also log a warning annotated with the run id, and the worker
keeps draining. Interruption stays fatal, and closing the scope may drop
records queued behind an in-flight write.

### JournalLogger.TelemetryLog

```ts
const TelemetryLog: Schema.Struct<{
  version: Schema.Literal<1>
  level: Schema.Literals<["All", "Fatal", "Error", "Warn", "Info", "Debug", "Trace", "None"]>
  message: Schema.Unknown
  annotations: Schema.Record<Schema.String, Schema.Unknown>
  cause: typeof TelemetryCause
  fiberId: Schema.Int
  traceId: Schema.optionalKey<Schema.String>
  spanId: Schema.optionalKey<Schema.String>
  timestamp: Schema.String
}>
type TelemetryLog = typeof TelemetryLog.Type
```

The durable wire shape of one forwarded log record. `traceId` and `spanId` are
present only when a span was active. `timestamp` is ISO-8601. Every persisted
`telemetry.log` payload decodes with this schema: a projection that would not
degrades to a total record with an empty cause rather than to a payload
consumers throw on.

### JournalLogger.TelemetryCause

```ts
const TelemetryCause: Schema.Struct<{
  version: Schema.Literal<1>
  reasons: Schema.Array<typeof TelemetryCauseReason>
}>
type TelemetryCause = typeof TelemetryCause.Type
```

A versioned structural Effect cause. Effect stores composed failures as an
ordered reason list, and the projection preserves that order and each
discriminator.

### JournalLogger.TelemetryCauseReason

```ts
const TelemetryCauseReason: Schema.Union<[
  typeof TelemetryFail,
  typeof TelemetryDie,
  typeof TelemetryInterrupt
]>
type TelemetryCauseReason = typeof TelemetryCauseReason.Type
```

One reason in a persisted cause. `TelemetryFail` carries `error`,
`TelemetryDie` carries `defect`, and `TelemetryInterrupt` carries a
non-negative `fiberId` or `null`. All three are exported individually.

### JournalLogger.InvalidJournalLoggerOptions

```ts
class InvalidJournalLoggerOptions {
  readonly code: "invalid_journal_logger_options"
  readonly path: string
  readonly message: string
}
```

The stable logger-configuration refusal, raised during layer acquisition.

### JournalLogger constants

```ts
const maximumCapacity: number // 65536
const maximumSnapshotBytes: number // 1048576
const maximumSnapshotMembers: number // 4096
const maximumSnapshotDepth: number // 64
const unrenderableMarker: string // "[Unrenderable]"
const truncatedMarker: string // "[Truncated]"
```

A snapshot admits at most `maximumSnapshotBytes` of encoded data,
`maximumSnapshotMembers` container members, and `maximumSnapshotDepth`
container edges. Unreadable values become `unrenderableMarker`, values past a
ceiling become `truncatedMarker`, and deeper values become the journal's
`[Deep]` marker. Container-shaped fields keep their shape, so annotations that
spent the whole budget arrive as `{ "[Truncated]": "[Truncated]" }` rather than
as a scalar. Text is bounded in one pass that never cuts a surrogate pair, and
the journal's own redaction rules run before queue admission.

## Metric

The runtime signals that cross package boundaries. Producers live in the
packages that know when to advance them; this module owns only the identifiers
and the handles.

### Metric handles

```ts
const runThroughput: Metric.Counter // "flows/run/throughput"
const activeSeats: Metric.Gauge // "flows/seat/active"
const quotaParks: Metric.Counter // "flows/quota/park"
const droppedLogRecords: Metric.Counter // "flows/observability/log/dropped"
```

- `runThroughput` advances after a terminal run transition commits in
  [`@smthrs/run-store`](/api/run-store).
- `activeSeats` is held for the lifetime of a production `Agent.run` stream in
  [`@smthrs/agent`](/api/agent) and released on success, failure, or
  interruption.
- `quotaParks` advances when a sealed quota decision is first executed, not
  when it is replayed after a wake or a process restart.
- `droppedLogRecords` advances once per record lost by `JournalLogger`.

Step-cache lookup and write counters remain owned by
[`@smthrs/step-cache`](/api/step-cache); this package does not duplicate those
handles.

### Metric.registry

```ts
const registry: {
  readonly runThroughput: typeof runThroughput
  readonly activeSeats: typeof activeSeats
  readonly quotaParks: typeof quotaParks
  readonly droppedLogRecords: typeof droppedLogRecords
}
```

All four handles as one object, for a host that enumerates them. The four
series names are the dashboard contract; treat them as public API.

## Otel

Provider-neutral composition for OpenTelemetry providers the application
already built. This module allocates no exporter.

### Otel.Options

```ts
interface Options {
  readonly resource: Resource.Configuration
  readonly tracerProvider?:
    | Api.TracerProvider
    | ((resource: Resource) => Api.TracerProvider)
    | undefined
  readonly loggerProvider?:
    | LoggerProvider
    | ((resource: Resource) => LoggerProvider)
    | undefined
  readonly metricReader?: (() => MetricReader | ReadonlyArray<MetricReader>) | undefined
  readonly loggerMergeWithExisting?: boolean | undefined
  readonly metricTemporality?: OtelMetrics.TemporalityPreference | undefined
}
```

`metricTemporality` is `"cumulative"` or `"delta"`.

Ownership differs by field. `tracerProvider` and `loggerProvider` are borrowed:
the layer bridges onto them and never flushes or shuts one down, including a
provider a factory returned. `metricReader` is owned: the factory runs once
during layer acquisition, after resource validation, and closing the layer's
scope shuts down every reader it returned. Build the readers inside the
factory. Returning a reader that a longer-lived composition still exports
through disables that reader when this scope closes.

### Otel.layerOtel

```ts
const layerOtel: (options: Options) => Layer.Layer<never, Resource.InvalidResourceConfiguration>
```

Bridges Effect's tracer, logger, and metrics onto the supplied providers and
the readers the `metricReader` factory returns, over the validated resource.
Each bridge is installed only when its provider or factory is supplied, and a
factory that returns an empty array registers no reader at all.

### Otel.layerNoop

```ts
const layerNoop: Layer.Layer<never>
```

A no-op OTEL layer, for callers that want an explicit optional slot.

## NodeOtel

Node-only OTLP/HTTP OpenTelemetry SDK setup. Import it from
`@smthrs/observability/NodeOtel`; it is not re-exported from the root, because
it resolves Node-only host modules and would break the root's browser bundle.

### NodeOtel.Options

```ts
interface Options {
  readonly endpoint: string
  readonly resource: Resource.Configuration
  readonly shutdownTimeout?: Duration.Input | undefined
  readonly exportIntervalMillis?: number | undefined
}
```

`endpoint` is decoded exactly as `Otlp.Options.baseUrl` is, and a refusal names
the path `endpoint`.

### NodeOtel.layerOtel

```ts
const layerOtel: (options: Options) => Layer.Layer<
  never,
  Resource.InvalidResourceConfiguration | Endpoint.InvalidExporterEndpoint
>
```

Builds a scoped Node OTLP/HTTP layer for all three signals: a
`BatchSpanProcessor`, a `BatchLogRecordProcessor`, and a
`PeriodicExportingMetricReader`, each behind its own OTLP exporter. Exporter
objects are created only when the layer is built. Closing the scope
force-flushes both batch processors and collects the metric reader once, so
release rather than the interval is the deterministic flush.

## BrowserOtel

Browser OpenTelemetry SDK setup with explicitly injected processors. Import it
from `@smthrs/observability/BrowserOtel`.

### BrowserOtel.Options

```ts
interface Options {
  readonly resource: Resource.Configuration
  readonly spanProcessor?: (() => SpanProcessor | ReadonlyArray<SpanProcessor>) | undefined
  readonly logRecordProcessor?: (() => LogRecordProcessor | ReadonlyArray<LogRecordProcessor>) | undefined
  readonly metricReader?: (() => MetricReader | ReadonlyArray<MetricReader>) | undefined
  readonly loggerMergeWithExisting?: boolean | undefined
}
```

Processors and readers are created by the caller's factories, which keeps this
module free of Node imports and free of browser exporter policy. Every factory
is owned: it runs once during layer acquisition, after resource validation, and
the web SDK shuts down everything it returned when the scope closes. A factory
that returns an empty array installs nothing for that signal.

### BrowserOtel.layerOtel

```ts
const layerOtel: (options: Options) => Layer.Layer<never, Resource.InvalidResourceConfiguration>
```

Builds a scoped browser OpenTelemetry layer over the validated resource. A
layer with no processor factories at all still builds; it provides the resource
and bridges nothing.
