/**
 * Default OTLP export wiring for flows telemetry.
 *
 * The store packages already open spans through Effect's tracer and update
 * `Metric` counters on their hot paths; what they deliberately do not do is
 * ship an exporter. This module is that exporter: one layer that installs
 * Effect's own OTLP logger, metrics exporter, and tracer
 * (`effect/unstable/observability/Otlp`) against a collector endpoint, with
 * the flows service identity filled in. Nothing beyond `effect` is involved;
 * no OpenTelemetry SDK dependency.
 *
 * Browser support is met by construction rather than by a no-op variant:
 * export happens over Effect's `HttpClient`, and {@link layerFetch} binds the
 * `fetch` implementation the host already has, so no entry point here ever
 * resolves a `node:` built-in. See the
 * {@link https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/api/observability | observability API contract}.
