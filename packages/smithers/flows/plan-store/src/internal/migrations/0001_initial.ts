/**
 * Initial persisted plan schema.
 *
 * This package owns `flows_plans`, `flows_plan_nodes`, and `flows_plan_edges`
 * and reserves migration id block `4000`, so this migration is id `4001` — see
 * `@smthrs/database`'s `Migrations` for how the blocks compose (the journal,
 * run store, step cache, and engine store hold `0`, `1000`, `2000`, `3000`).
 *
 * **Append-only is enforced in the schema, not by convention.**
 * A plan with dynamic nodes is not invalidated by elaboration, it *grows*; the triggers below make a rewritten or deleted
 * node row an error the database raises rather than a rule a caller can
 * forget. The `flows_plans` row itself moves forward — a generation and a
 * digest advance as subgraphs land — so it accepts an UPDATE, but only one
 * that raises the generation and leaves the approved base digest alone.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
