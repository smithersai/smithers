/**
 * Pins plan identity in the forward-only trigger.
 *
 * The hardened trigger from `0002_append_only_hardening` guards `generation`,
 * `base_digest`, `flow`, and `created_at_ms`, but not `plan_id`. A forward
 * UPDATE could therefore rename a plan while raising its generation, stranding
 * the plan's immortal node and edge rows under the old id and making that id
 * unrecordable — the same stranding class `0002` closed for DELETE, left open
 * on the identity column. Append-only is enforced in the schema, not by
 * convention, so this migration recreates the trigger with the `plan_id` pin.
 *
 * This package reserves migration id block `4000`, so this migration is id
 * `4003`. See `@smthrs/database`'s `Migrations` for namespaced composition.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
