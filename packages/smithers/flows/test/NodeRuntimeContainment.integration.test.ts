/**
 * The containment matrix, driven through a real durable cancel.
 *
 * `packages/smithers/agent/std`'s `ExecContainment` suite pins the same two shapes directly
 * against a spawner. This one asks the question the release policy actually
 * words: after `smithers cancel`, does the machine still carry anything the
 * run started. So everything here is the production composition:
 * `NodeRuntime.layerHost` over a real SQLite file, a flow body reaching the
 * GUARDED spawner, and a second driver over the same file writing the
 * cancellation request the owner picks up on its heartbeat.
 *
 * Three claims, one per case:
 *
 *  1. A cancelled run leaves no `PPID 1` orphan. The action starts
 *     `<sleeper> & wait`, so the background process is one nothing holds a
 *     handle for; only the process-group kill can reach it.
 *  2. A `SIGTERM`-ignoring group dies inside `forceKillAfter` plus a second.
 *     `containment: { graceMs }` is the deadline `ContainedSpawner` installs
 *     on every command (`forceKillAfter ?? graceMs`), and an ignored
 *     signal behavior is inherited across `exec`, so nothing in the group honours
 *     the signal and the escalation is the only thing that ends it.
 *  3. Every guarded spawn in this composition resolves through the contained
 *     spawner. The evidence is durable rather than structural: the host's
 *     journal carries a `flows.host.process-spawned.v1` record for what the
 *     action started, and only `ContainedSpawner` writes one.
 *
 * The survivor check is a `ps` scan for a uniquely named sleeper script
 * across every process on the machine. Asserting a recorded pid is gone would
 * answer a weaker question than the one containment is about.
 *
 * The forked `Flow.execute` fiber is interrupted at the end of each case, the
 * same way `NodeRuntime.test.ts` does: after a cross-driver cancel the run
 * settles durably but that fiber does not, which is the cancel-durability
 * lane's `RunDriver` defect (N-09) and not a containment claim.
