/**
 * The supported production composition, booted end to end over a real SQLite
 * file.
 *
 * `src/NodeRuntime.ts` is the one module in this package that a host program
 * calls to stand a durable engine up, and every claim its doc comment makes is
 * an ordering claim: the parent directory exists before the database opens,
 * migrations finish before a store is built, the engine is built over those
 * stores, and `registerFlows` finishes before the composed services are
 * exposed — so a persisted run cannot resume through this composition before
 * its flow has been registered. None of that is observable from a type, and a
 * double cannot establish any of it, so this suite drives the module the way a
 * program does: one temp-directory SQLite file, three separate scopes over it,
 * and `node:sqlite` reading the same file back independently.
 *
 * The three scopes are the whole journey. Scope one migrates, registers, runs
 * a flow to completion, and parks a second flow on a durable deferred. Its
 * closure is the graceful shutdown — the module installs no signal handlers,
 * so scope closure is the documented shutdown path. Scope two is a process
 * that completes the deferred but registers NO flow: the run must stay parked,
 * because the engine leaves a wake for an unregistered flow alone. Scope three
 * registers the flow again and touches nothing else; the registration sweep is
 * what has to notice the completed deferred and drive the run home.
 *
 * The host seams are supplied here rather than by the library, the same way a
 * program supplies them: a tiny Node filesystem bridge for the one directory
 * creation the composition owns, SHA-256 over `node:crypto`, and a `Jj` stub
 * because the flows below take no compensable snapshot.

/**
 * Shared-store execution routing: `Options.canExecute`.
 *
 * The option's documented job is to route "shared-store runs to the host
 * configured for their workspace", and the whole of its wiring is one field
 * forwarded into `EngineStore.layer` (`src/NodeRuntime.ts`,
 * `canExecute: validated.canExecute`). Validation cannot see that field: a
 * composition that dropped it would still refuse a non-function eagerly and
 * still never invoke a valid one before it builds, so the eager-validation
 * case above stays green while the option does nothing.
 *
 * What pins the forwarding is a run the wrong host must LEAVE and the right
 * host must finish, over one SQLite file — the deployment the option exists
 * for. `@smthrs/engine-store`'s own ownership suite drives `RunDriver`
 * directly and the CLI's workspace suite exercises the routing helper;
 * neither reaches this composition.
