/**
 * What survives a host that was KILLED, and what the next one does about it.
 *
 * The signal test next door proves the graceful half: a host that is asked to
 * stop runs its finalizers and takes its children with it. This is the other
 * half, and the one A31 exists for. A `SIGKILL`ed host runs no finalizer, so
 * the agents it started keep running with nobody holding a handle to them, and
 * the only thing that can ever reach them again is the record it wrote to the
 * journal before it died.
 *
 * Everything here is real: a real child process running the real `layerHost`
 * composition over a real SQLite file, a real `SIGKILL`, a real orphaned
 * process group, and a second incarnation of the same `hostId` over the same
 * database. A double at any of those points would prove nothing, because the
 * subject is precisely what is left when no code of ours got to run.
