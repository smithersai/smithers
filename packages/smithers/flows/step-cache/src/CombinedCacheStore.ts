/**
 * Two step-result tiers composed into one: local first, remote second, with
 * write-back into the local SQL store.
 *
 * The shape is Bazel's `CombinedCache.downloadActionResult`, from
 * `src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/remote/CombinedCache.java` in
 * {@link https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel | bazelbuild/bazel}: consult the
 * disk cache, fall back to the remote cache only on a miss, and write what the
 * remote returned back into the disk cache so the next lookup is local. An
 * exact local provenance record refused by age stops the lookup with a miss;
 * it never falls through to the shared head.
 *
 * **Publication order is the caller's job, not this store's.** A cache entry
 * must never be observable in the shared tier while an artifact it references
 * is missing from the shared artifact tier. That is Bazel's REAPI ordering
 * constraint, stated in that repository's `remote/UploadManifest.java` as
 * "action results may fail to validate server-side if they are accessed before
 * all blobs they refer to are present". `@smthrs/engine-store`'s
 * `ArtifactSync` enforces it around `put`. This module cannot: it does not
 * know what an entry references.
 *
 * *When* the shared copy is written is configurable for the same reason — see
 * {@link Options.publication}. A caller holding a write transaction takes
 * `"deferred"` and publishes afterwards.
