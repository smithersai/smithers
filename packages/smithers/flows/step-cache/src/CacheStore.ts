/**
 * Durable content-addressed step result storage.
 *
 * This store receives already-computed digests and recorded results. It does
 * not interpret step layers, capabilities, or result metadata: `result` and
 * `meta` are admitted as bounded, inert JSON and stored verbatim.
 *
 * This module owns the service contract and its tag. The entry model, the
 * admission policy every tier shares, and the SQL implementation live in
 * `internal/` modules that depend on the contract and never on another tier.
 * The export list below re-exports them, so this subpath stays the one import
 * for the whole public surface.
 *
 * See the {@link https://smithers.sh/docs/concepts/content-addressing | step-key contract}
 * and {@link https://smithers.sh/docs/concepts/durable-execution | journal architecture}.
