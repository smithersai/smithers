/**
 * Closes the late-linked-child cancellation race (issue #83).
 *
 * Cancellation and admission are two separate serialized write transactions
 * over the same store:
 *
 * - `interrupt` requests cancellation for the parent AND for every durable
 *   descendant visible in `flows_run_parents` at that instant.
 * - `ensureRun` records the parent edge and creates the child run row in a
 *   transaction of its own.
 *
 * They interleave in both orders. Admission-first is safe by construction:
 * the edge is committed before the cascade walks it. Cancellation-first used
 * to leak a live child — the cascade saw no edge because none existed yet,
 * and the admission that followed created a fresh, uncancelled run row under
 * a parent that was already cancelled and whose drive may have been gone. The
 * in-process finalizer that "usually" caught this is best-effort and can have
 * requested the child before its row existed, so nothing necessarily
 * re-cascaded and the child ran to completion under a cancelled parent.
 *
 * The invariant these tests pin is that the two transactions are closed under
 * ordering, with no third interleaving: whichever serializes first, the child
 * ends up cancel-requested. Admission inherits the parent's durable
 * cancellation inside the same transaction that created the child row, so the
 * activation guard cancels the run instead of executing the flow body.
 *
 * Everything here is ordered by explicit transaction sequencing and latches.
 * There are no sleeps, and the assertions on `executed` are what prove the
 * flow body never ran.
