/**
 * A durable wait taken from inside an action, on the run's own instance.
 *
 * `SuspendedParking` proves the flow-body case: a handler that calls
 * `DurableClock.sleep` or awaits a `DurableDeferred` directly parks and wakes.
 * The nested case is the one every harness cell call takes — each `ctx.call` is
 * an action, and the flow binding it dispatches is handed the *run's* context,
 * so the wait it arms runs one dispatch below the flow body under the same
 * `FlowInstance`.
 *
 * Both waiting vocabularies land on one strand: `DurableClock.sleep`,
 * `DurableQueue.take` and `WaitFor` — the wait an approval or a signal parks on
 * — all await a `DurableDeferred`, which is the only place a flow suspension is
 * raised. These cases take the strand under all three wake sources — the timer,
 * the delivered signal, and the approval an operator answers — so a fix that
 * only closed the clock path would fail here. The approval case also proves the
 * waiting declaration reaches the row: a park a reason sweep cannot find is a
 * park nobody can answer.
