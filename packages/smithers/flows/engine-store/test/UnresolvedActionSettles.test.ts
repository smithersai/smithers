/**
 * N-06 on the real SQLite engine-store: a plan action with no implementation
 * settles its run instead of stranding the row.
 *
 * The interpreter's refusal is a wiring defect, not a body outcome, so no flow
 * declares it. That makes the channel the refusal travels on load-bearing
 * here in a way no in-memory engine can show: the durable driver encodes the
 * settled exit through `Flow.Result({ success, error: flow.errorSchema })`
 * (`internal/RunDriver.ts`, `encodeResult`), and a flow declaring no error
 * encodes its error channel as `Schema.Never`. A refusal delivered as a typed
 * FAILURE therefore cannot be encoded at all: `encodeResult` dies with
 * `Expected never at ["exit"]["cause"]["failures"][0]["error"]`, the run row
 * stays `running` and owned with no `finishedAtMs`, and the stale sweep
 * re-drives it into the same defect forever. The refusal is a DEFECT carrying
 * the `InterpreterError` itself, which `Schema.Defect` encodes, so the run
 * settles `failed` and the persisted cause still names the action.
 *
 * `packages/smithers/flows/engine/test/DurableLogEngine.ts` cannot pin this: it keeps
 * `Flow.Result` objects in a `Map` and never runs the flow codec.
