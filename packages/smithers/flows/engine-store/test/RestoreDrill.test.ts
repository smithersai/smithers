/**
 * The automated restore drill: a live durable engine takes real writes, a hot
 * backup is captured mid-action over a second connection, the backup is
 * restored into a fresh directory, and the restored store both fences the
 * pre-backup owner out and resumes the run under a new owner.
 *
 * The drill pins the four DR guarantees end to end:
 *
 * 1. `backup` is hot: it runs while the run is `running` under a live owner,
 *    with an admitted attempt still in flight and a journal writer appending.
 * 2. `restore` + `fence` close the resurrection hazard: before the fence the
 *    pre-backup owner's heartbeat still lands on the restored store; after it
 *    every fenced operation reports `FenceLost` / `fence_lost`.
 * 3. The restored run resumes correctly: recorded attempts replay without
 *    re-executing, the in-flight attempt re-executes under the new owner, and
 *    post-backup work is simply absent.
 * 4. The source store is untouched: its owner keeps its fence there.
