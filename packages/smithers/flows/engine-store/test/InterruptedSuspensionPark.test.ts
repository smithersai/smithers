/**
 * A round interrupted AFTER its flow asked to suspend parks under the reason
 * the flow was waiting for, not as `released`.
 *
 * `InterruptReleaseReclaim.test.ts` covers the other half: a round that had
 * not asked for anything is a shutdown, and `released` is what it is (issue
 * #39). This file covers the park, which the release validation found by watching a
 * `smithers up -d` process park a run and exit. The round's own settlement
 * derives the same three answers a few statements later, so losing the race to
 * a shutdown must not lose the classification with it: a `released` row
 * carries no wake time and no token, so a run suspended on a 150-second clock
 * came back as a run whose owner merely went away, and every sweep had to
 * re-drive it blind instead of waking it when its deadline fell due.
 *
 * The shape here is the executor's own. `AgentSession` forks the agent body
 * under the registered handler and joins it, so a suspension taken inside that
 * fork is written on the shared flow instance while the handler is still in
 * the round; a process exit lands its interrupt exactly there.
