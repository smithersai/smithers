/**
 * Pins issue #39: a run released by a non-cancel interruption (process
 * shutdown, heartbeat self-interrupt) must remain reachable. The #26 release
 * path transitioned the run to `suspended` without parking it, so it had no
 * durable waiting row: no sweep ever re-drove it, and the parked-run cancel
 * sweeper (which enumerates only `waitingRuns()`) could never deliver a
 * durable `requestCancel`. The release must park with a durable reason so
 * the run is re-drivable and cancellable.
