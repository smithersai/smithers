 * Issue #171: corrupt recorded evidence on a SUCCEEDED attempt row under the

 * cannot be evicted and re-executed like a corrupt cache row (#164) — its side
 * effects already ran, so blind re-execution would break exactly-once. Instead,
 * the corrupt boundary evidence is journalled and quarantined off the succeeded
 * row. The first resume parks visibly; the next returns the durable outcome
 * without touching the poisoned evidence or re-running the action.
