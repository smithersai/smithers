/**
 * Pins the crash-consistency invariant: every engine-store lifecycle journal
 * entry commits in the SAME write transaction as the executable state
 * transition it describes.
 *
 * Before this, the store wrote first and journalled second — the attempt row
 * then the attempt event, the run-row CAS then the decision — so a crash in
 * the interstitial left durable state the journal could not explain. Audit,
 * sync, and time travel read the journal as the account of record and saw a
 * hole in it.
 *
 * Each test injects a crash at one closed interstitial through the
 * `Journal.Notifying` fault harness (Skyframe's `NotifyingHelper`, adapted)
 * and asserts journal/state EQUIVALENCE after the restart: either both halves
 * of the pair are durable, or neither is. Prior art for the invariant is
 * Temporal, which submits mutable state and its event batches as one
 * persistence request
 * (`reference/temporal/service/history/workflow/transaction_impl.go`).
