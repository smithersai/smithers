 * row. The #39 sweep enumerated only `waitingRuns()`, so nothing ever
 * re-drove such a run — no steal (reachable only through `drive()`), no
 * cancel delivery (`requestCancel` was write-only forever). The periodic
 * sweep must also enumerate stale-running rows and re-drive them through the
 * existing claim/steal path — the analog of Temporal's task-timeout
 * re-dispatch.
 *
 * Uses the SQL `DurableEngineState` over the same database as `RunStore`,
 * because the hard-kill evidence (a `running` row with a stale
 * `heartbeat_at_ms`) lives in `flows_runs` itself.
