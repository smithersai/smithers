/**
 * What the driver writes for a settlement the flow's own codec rejects.
 *
 * release validation found the terminal transition guarded by
 * `Effect.orDie` around that encode: `engine-store: coordinated drain failed
 * for run-1 SchemaError: Expected JSON value at ["exit"]["cause"][0]["error"]`,
 * with the run row left `running` under an owner that had exited. A flow
 * declaring `Schema.Unknown` for its error channel — which is what
 * `@smthrs/agent`'s `agent/run` declares — encodes that channel through
 * `Schema.Json`, and `Schema.Json` rejects every class instance, so every
 * tagged error an agent body fails with lands here.
 *
 * The release policy allows one terminal write per run. These pin that the
 * write happens.
