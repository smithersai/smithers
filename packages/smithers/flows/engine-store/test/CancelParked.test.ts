/**
 * Pins issue #27: a durable cancel request against a suspended (parked) run
 * must actually be delivered. The driver's cancel poll only exists while an
 * owner drives the flow, so a parked run needs (a) a sweeper that observes
 * `cancel_requested_at_ms` and wakes the run, and (b) a cancel guard on the
 * re-activation transition so a resumed cancel-requested run cancels instead
 * of re-executing flow side effects.
