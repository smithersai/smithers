/**
 * Reading a whole run tree's open waits, not just the named run's own row.
 *
 * On Smithers Cloud, `run-3` of `coding/request` parked for good. The person
 * it was waiting on never saw the question, because `coding/request` itself
 * was parked on `event` while the `HumanTask` — `coding-clarification` — was
 * three executions further down, on `coding/PreparePlan`. Every reader in the
 * product asked `waiting(runId)` about the run an operator had named, got the
 * root's own `event` row back, and reported that nothing was waiting on a
 * person: the approvals inbox stayed empty and `Signal` answered
 * `/control/NoMatchingWait`.
 *
 * `waitingTree` is the read that answers the question actually being asked —
 * "does this run tree owe anybody an answer" — and `waiting_request` is what
 * makes the answer renderable rather than merely present.
