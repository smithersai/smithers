/**
 * N-09: a cancellation from another driver has to settle the caller.
 *
 * The parity audit's containment gap. After a durable cancel written by a
 * driver that does not own the run, the run reaches `cancelled` and the
 * process group dies — and the `Flow.execute` fiber that asked for the run
 * never settles. `poll` reads the result off `state_json`, and a cancelled run
 * has none: cancellation is recorded as `cancellation`, not as a
 * `Flow.Result`. So the durable `execute` answered `Suspended`, and the
 * engine's suspended-retry loop did exactly what that answer means — slept,
 * resumed, re-drove, and asked again, for as long as the caller lived.
 * `packages/smithers/flows/test/NodeRuntime.test.ts` documents the workaround, ending
 * its cross-driver case by interrupting the fiber by hand.
 *
 * The memory engine settles this shape as `Complete` with an interrupt cause
 * (`layerMemory.ts` `interrupt`), and that is the parity restored here: a run
 * cancelled underneath its caller interrupts the caller.
 *
 * Two engines over one store, with distinct owner identities: the cancelling
 * engine holds no instance and no coordinator entry for the run, so its
 * `interrupt` can only write the durable request — which is all a second
 * process can do either. The connection is shared because that is a harness
 * detail; the arbitration under test is the run row.
