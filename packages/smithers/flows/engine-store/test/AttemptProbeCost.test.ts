 * Pins issue #77: probing the surviving attempts for an action key must
 * not cost up to 32 sequential `AttemptStore.get` point reads per fresh
 * dispatch (doubled when the policy declares `expirationMs`). Over SQL
 * durable state the probe is one `attemptSurvivors` range read, so the
 * counting store below sees only the executor's own row lookups — a scan
 * regression reappears as dozens of gets and fails the bound.
