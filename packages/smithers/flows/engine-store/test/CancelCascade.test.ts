/**
 * A durable cancellation must reach the linked children of the run it
 * cancelled, and must release the flow scope a parked run retained.
 *
 * Both properties used to hold only in-process and only by accident.
 * Child-flow handling rode on `FlowInstance.interrupted`, an ephemeral flag
 * that `FlowEngine.make`'s parent link reads and that only the process which
 * called `interrupt` ever sets: a cancellation observed from durable state —
 * another CLI, another worker, a lease recovery, this process's own cancel
 * poll — left every linked child running. And `Flow.intoResult` deliberately
 * keeps the flow scope OPEN across a suspension, but nothing owned that scope
 * once the round returned, so cancelling a parked flow ran none of its
 * finalizers and every park leaked a scope.
 *
 * The cascade is therefore driven by the DURABLE `flows_run_parents` edge
 * table, and the scope by an explicit per-run retention whose removal is the
 * close (`RunDriver.releaseRetainedScope`), so "exactly once" is a property of
 * the state machine rather than of a timing hook.
