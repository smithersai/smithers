/**
 * N-08: a run parked inside {@link module:DurableDeferred.raceAll} resumes on
 * the durable engine.
 *
 * A race between a durable wait and a durable timer is the shape every
 * deadline in the tree is built from, so a durable engine that parks the race
 * and cannot re-enter it makes `HumanTask.timeoutMs`, `Action.raceAll`, and
 * every wait-versus-timer race unusable. The defect was in the attempt row:
 * a body that parked ended its fiber by self-interruption, and the dispatch
 * recorded that interrupt as a `failed` attempt, which the replay branch then
 * rethrew on every later drive — the run died with "All fibers interrupted
 * without error" instead of resuming. The memory engine writes no attempt row
 * and so never saw it, which is why the cases here run against the real SQLite
 * stores (`TestStores.layerAt`).
