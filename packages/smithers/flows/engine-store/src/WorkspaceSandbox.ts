/**
 * Functional workspace transactions for action execution.
 *
 * An action body normally mutates the host tree in place, which leaves the
 * engine two bad options: trust the declaration, or diff the whole repository
 * after the fact. This module takes the third one. The body runs against an
 * **isolated workspace** seeded with exactly its declared read set; its writes
 * are a value — a whole-tree diff — that reaches the host only through an
 * explicit {@link Service.materialize} step with preconditions and rollback.
 *
 * Two consequences follow, and they are the reason this exists:
 *
 * - **Whole-tree write observation is structural.** The transaction *is* the
 *   tree, so "did this body write outside its declared write set" is a map
 *   comparison, not an inference. `StepBoundary`'s filesystem layer can only
 *   re-measure paths it was told about, which is why it never claims
 *   `wholeTreeWritesVerified` and why nothing it settled could enter the
 *   cross-run cache.
 * - **The host is untouched until copy-back.** An execution whose observations
 *   contradict its declaration is {@link Invalidated}, and an invalidated
 *   result exposes provenance and violations *only* — never the candidate
 *   output, files, or queued effects.
 *
 * This is a **deterministic transaction model, not a security boundary** — the
 * same caveat the proof of concept carried. A body that reaches the host
 * through a service this module does not seed (a spawned native process, an
 * undecorated socket) is outside the transaction. Actually denying that
 * ambient access requires a machine boundary such as the providers in
 * `packages/smithers/flows/sandbox/docs/api.md`. The one host
 * write this module *does* perform is confined, however: copy-back resolves
 * symlinks before it lands a byte and refuses any target whose canonical
 * location escapes the workspace root.
 *
 * Settled bundles reach the host without a human review gate. Governing
 * design: `docs/concepts/workspace-transactions.md`.
