/**
 * Drives a persisted plan: the node scheduler.
 *
 * `@smthrs/plan` makes the plan a value; this makes it run. The scheduler
 * walks the persisted graph, dispatches ready nodes through the same
 * `internal/ActionPersistence` seam every action uses — so the shared step
 * cache, the workspace sandbox's execute→materialize transaction, attempt
 * rows, and the fenced journal all apply unchanged — and records an
 * evaluation outcome per node.
 *
 * ## What it is, and what it is not
 *
 * Skyframe's `AbstractParallelEvaluator` is the prior art for the state
 * machine (`CHECK_DEPENDENCIES → VERIFIED_CLEAN | NEEDS_REBUILDING →
 * REBUILDING → DONE`) and `EvaluationProgressReceiver` for the outcome
 * vocabulary. Two deliberate deviations:
 *
 * 1. **No cache-invalidating node visitor.** Content addressing governs
 *    reuse. Private reverse indexes propagate settled outcomes and readiness,
 *    never dirty bits. Dispatch-time content measurement still decides
 *    whether a recorded result can serve the node.
 * 2. **Completion-driven, without Skyframe restarts.** Skyframe atomically
 *    signals reverse dependencies when one node settles. Our dependencies are
 *    declared in the plan before anything runs, so one coordinator can make
 *    the equivalent decision from the plan, settled state, and scheduling
 *    permits: every completion is reconciled and immediately opens another
 *    admission pass. Giving up the wavefront barrier also gives up its
 *    trivially serialized reconciliation; draining and applying the durable
 *    deviation journal after each settlement, before reevaluating downstream
 *    readiness, restores that ordering without holding unrelated ready cones.
 *    The coordinator is the sole writer of scheduling state, which keeps every
 *    admission decision deterministic without the `DeterministicHelper` the
 *    vault rejected.
 *
 * ## The three limits
 *
 * The same number must never
 * stand in for graph width, scheduler admission, and provider capacity. This
 * module owns the middle one only: `concurrency.steps` is the leaf-execution
 * cap, and `concurrency.agents` is the subset cap an agent node consumes in
 * addition. Structural width is whatever the plan says; seats belong to
 * `Agent Adapters` and are not modelled here.
 *
 * Under contention, ready work is ordered by effective priority — declared
 * `priority` plus one point per capacity-constrained admission pass. A ready
 * node gains a point exactly when a pass considers it but cannot give it the
 * required permits. Aging is what lets priority change latency without
 * permitting starvation; equal effective priorities preserve deterministic
 * plan order.
 *
 * ## Observing the world exactly once
 *
 * The torn-run rule: never re-observe the
 * world mid-run. Reads with no preceding writer are **source** inputs; their
 * digests and glob membership are durably recorded before dispatch and restored
 * on reopening. Preceding producers' outputs are measured after settlement —
 * observing our own output, not the world. Later and self-writes are not source
 * producers. New generations retain prior pins and record new observations.

/**

 * - `clean` — a recorded result served it and no executor ran. This includes
 *   same-run durable attempt replay for every tier, and shared-cache hits for
 *   eligible sealed work (`SUCCESS_VERSION_UNCHANGED`). It does not assert
 *   cross-run cache eligibility.
 * - `failed` — the node executed and failed, or reconciliation failed it.
 * - `skipped` — its cone prevented dispatch, or `stop-merge` stopped a
 *   conflicted attempt in favour of a merge node. The latter has nonzero
 *   attempts; skipped does not imply that its executor never ran. Skyframe
 *   splits failure by version instead; a content-addressed store never serves
 *   a failure from cache, so that split has no meaning here and this one does.
 * - `deferred`: a selection guess postponed this sink
 *   (`docs/guides/defer-work-with-selection.md`). It never dispatched,
 *   wrote no cache row, and is journaled as a debt for a later guess-free
 *   pass. Distinct from `skipped` — the work was runnable, a guess postponed
 *   it — and never reported as passed.
