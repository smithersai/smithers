/**
 * The probabilistic-selection seam: guesses may schedule work; only real
 * dependencies decide truth.
 *
 * `docs/guides/defer-work-with-selection.md` describes learning, from run
 * history, which changes *tend to* affect which flows, and letting those
 * guesses do exactly three things: suggest extra work, postpone work that
 * almost never fails, and order the queue. This module is the engine-store
 * half of the proposal: the belief and verdict types, the pluggable
 * `Selection` service, and the deterministic default layers. `PlanScheduler`
 * is the one consumer, and it offers only **sinks** — nodes nothing in the
 * plan depends on — because deferring a node something consumes would block
 * or corrupt its consumers. Meta's Predictive Test Selection (ICSE-SEIP 2019)
 * skips tests under exactly this restriction: tests are sinks.
 *
 * Four v1 laws bound what a verdict may do, and the scheduler's tests assert
 * each:
 *
 * 1. A verdict never enters key material and never changes a cache row: an
 *    admitted node's step key and cached result are computed exactly as if
 *    selection did not exist.
 * 2. `deferred` is never passed. The node does not execute, writes no cache
 *    row, and is journaled as a debt (`flows.engine.selection-deferred`)
 *    that a later guess-free pass repays.
 * 3. Only sinks are deferrable. A Defer or Propose verdict naming anything
 *    else is ignored and journaled as an inconsistency observation —
 *    Skyframe's `GraphInconsistencyReceiver` shape: note it, decide, never
 *    wire the detector to /dev/null.
 * 4. Guesses add or postpone, never remove. A node the plan requires runs
 *    exactly as today, and the run-level `full` override restores full
 *    execution the way `--fresh` ignores the cache.
 * 5. Training only moves confidence: it never creates edges or touches the
 *    journal, and misses reduce confidence faster than hits accrue it.
 * 6. Repayment is a pure widening: `debt(runId)` keeps the v1 same-run fold,
 *    while `debt(runId, { repaidBy })` additionally accepts settlements from
 *    listed recertification runs.
 * 7. The plan card, risk annotation, and read-set proposal helpers are pure
 *    functions of plain data and require no services.
 *
 * Pluggability is dependency injection at the owning seam, exactly as
 * `Reconciliation` beside it: {@link layerNoop} admits everything and is the
 * behavioral default when no layer is provided; {@link layerHeuristic} is a
 * pure, deterministic function of the pinned belief snapshot; a model-backed
 * selector is a different `Layer`, lives outside this package, and this
 * package must not grow a model dependency.
 *
 * Deliberately still out of scope, recorded here so the absences read as
 * decisions rather than oversights: the model-backed selection layer (this
 * package must not grow a model dependency), selection CLI verbs (`@smthrs/cli`
 * owns CLI verbs and `smithers gc` drives `Retention.collect`, but no selection
 * verbs are exposed yet), approval routing from risk (approval machinery lives
 * elsewhere), auto-appending proposed nodes (pending human review), and
 * scheduled recertification cadence (a product/system-flow concern; this
 * module ships only the primitive).
