/**
 * Receiver for detected engine inconsistencies.
 *
 * Modeled on Skyframe's `GraphInconsistencyReceiver`: the store layer detects
 * an invariant violation — today, a content-addressed cache key that produced
 * a different result than the recorded row — and this service decides whether
 * the run fails or tolerates it. Either way the conflict is journaled, so the
 * detector is never wired to /dev/null.
 *
 * The `note` signature deliberately matches the plugin spec's
 * `cacheInconsistency` hook (`(event) => Effect<InconsistencyVerdict>`); the
 * strict layer is the future default plugin.
 *
 * The core default is strict so an invariant violation cannot pass silently.
 *
 * Governing designs: `docs/concepts/attempts-and-replay.md` and
 * `apps/site/src/content/docs/docs/concepts/flows-actions-plans.mdx`.
