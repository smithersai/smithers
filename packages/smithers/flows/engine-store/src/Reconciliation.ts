/**
 * The reconciliation seam: what happens when the world disagrees with the
 * declaration.
 *
 * `docs/guides/drive-a-plan.md` ("Install a reconciler") describes expected sets as the soft
 * mode: going outside them is allowed, journaled, and "triggers a
 * **reconciliation flow** — pluggable, a flow like everything else". The
 * deviation events have been emitted since the isolated-execution lane landed
 * (`internal/ActionPersistence.ts`, both `expectedSetDeviation` sites) and
 * had **no consumer at all**. This is the consumer, and
 * `PlanScheduler` is what feeds it.
 *
 * Pluggability is dependency injection at the owning seam, per the repository's
 * extension doctrine — there is no hook kernel. {@link layerDefault} installs a
 * deterministic verdict function; a model-backed reconciler is a different
 * `Layer` and lives in the agent packages. This package has no model
 * dependency and must not grow one.
 *
 * The three verdicts are exactly the vault's: **fail** the step where the
 * deviation is genuinely wrong, **reorder** — re-plan with the discovered
 * dependency made explicit — and **factor out** a shared step, where content
 * addressing does the heavy lifting because identical extracted steps collapse
 * to one key automatically.
