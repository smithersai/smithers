/**
 * The two-tier artifact protocol the step cache rides on: publish before the
 * entry, fetch on demand after it.
 *
 * This is the seam that makes a shared cache safe. A cache entry references
 * its large outputs by digest, so an entry that becomes observable while one
 * of those artifacts is still missing hands the next machine a hit it cannot
 * materialize. Bazel states the constraint at
 * `reference/bazel/.../remote/UploadManifest.java:630-633` — "action results
 * may fail to validate server-side if they are accessed before all blobs they
 * refer to are present" — and enforces it by ordering:
 * `findMissingDigests` → upload the missing → upload the `ActionResult` LAST.
 * {@link Service.publish} is that ordering, and `ActionPersistence` calls it
 * before `CacheStore.put`.
 *
 * The read direction is the same protocol in reverse, and how eagerly it runs
 * is the {@link DownloadPolicy}, declared on the shared tier itself
 * (`RemoteArtifacts.Options.downloadPolicy`) and split across two seams.
 * `all` fetches every referenced artifact into this host's store while
 * admitting the replay. `toplevel` and `minimal` fetch nothing here: one
 * batched probe establishes that the shared tier can serve them and the
 * transfer is left to the first read through `CombinedArtifacts`, which then
 * writes the blob back under `toplevel` and does not under `minimal`. This is
 * Bazel's `RemoteOutputChecker` dial
 * (`--remote_download_{all,toplevel,minimal}`) split the way our two seams
 * split: what a replay prefetches is this module's decision, what a read
 * materializes is the combined store's.
 *
 * Governing design: `packages/smithers/flows/artifacts/docs/api.md`.
