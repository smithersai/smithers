/**
 * Hot backup, verified restore, and restore-time fencing for the durable
 * flows store.
 *
 * A backup captures the whole SQLite database — journal, run store, step
 * cache, engine state, and the out-of-ladder objects created by
 * `internal/EngineStateSchema.ts` — with `VACUUM INTO`, which reads one
 * consistent snapshot under WAL while writers stay live. The content-addressed
 * artifact blobs are copied beside it, digest-verified, after the database
 * snapshot: results reference artifacts only after publication
 * (`packages/smithers/flows/step-cache/docs/api.md`), so a blob walk taken after the
 * database snapshot is a superset of every digest the snapshot references.
 * A manifest written last records the digests a restore must verify, so a
 * partial backup is detectable by its missing manifest.
 *
 * Restore never lets a pre-backup owner resurrect. The fencing token here is
 * the `OwnerId` triple persisted on `flows_runs` — Temporal's shard `rangeID`
 * equality check reduced to one SQL predicate (`reference/temporal`
 * `service/history/shard/context_impl.go`, `renewRangeLocked`). Temporal
 * fences a restored shard by bumping the persisted epoch above anything a
 * surviving owner could hold; the equivalent bump for an identity fence is
 * {@link fence}: clear every persisted claim and owner in one serialized write
 * transaction, so every pre-backup `OwnerId` fails its equality
 * compare-and-swap (`FenceLost`, journal `fence_lost`) and the restored runs
 * are claimable immediately instead of after the heartbeat staleness cutoff.
 *
 * Host access arrives through Effect's `FileSystem` and `SqlClient` tags and
 * hashing through the injected `Crypto` service, so the module carries no
 * platform binding. The SQL dialect is SQLite — a non-SQLite backend fails
 * with the `sql` code rather than pretending to snapshot. Every file is
 * stat-checked before it is buffered for hashing or copying. The configurable
 * ceiling defaults to {@link defaultMaxFileSizeBytes}; an oversized file fails
 * with the typed `io` code instead of reaching the host's allocation limit.

 * cleared and every run that was `running` at backup time is suspended with
 * its owner and heartbeat cleared. A surviving pre-backup owner then fails
 * every fenced operation against the restored store — `heartbeat` and

 * `fence_lost` — exactly as a stale Temporal owner fails its `rangeID`
 * compare-and-swap. The suspended runs are claimable immediately, without
 * waiting out the heartbeat staleness cutoff and without liveness evidence.
 *
 * Every migration recorded in the manifest must remain applied with the same
 * ID and namespaced name. Forward additions within any installed block are
 * compatible, including engine-store `3006` below an existing plan `4003`;
 * the current database layer applies them on open. A missing or renamed
 * historical entry fails `schema_mismatch` before ownership is cleared.

 * fenced on the run row's ownership, and the resuming engine adopts or
 * retries them under its own fresh owner.
