/**
 * Binds one ordered transaction boundary to a pair of stores.
 *
 * **The order is part of the package's contract.** Every fiber that needs
 * both boundaries takes `DurableEngineState.transaction` FIRST and opens the
 * journal's write transaction inside it. Never the other way around. The SQL
 * engine state cannot tell the difference, because its transaction and the
 * journal's are the same `DurableWriter` transaction and one of them nests as
 * a savepoint of the other either way. The memory engine state has a gate of
 * its own, and the contract requires the two implementations to be
 * semantically equal. Taking the journal transaction first leaves a fiber
 * holding the writer while it waits for that gate, which deadlocks against
 * any fiber holding the gate while it waits for the writer. Both waits keep the
 * caller's interruptibility: the state gate is taken first, then DurableWriter
 * queues for its own permit before entering Effect SQL's masked connection
 * acquisition. A journal-only writer never takes the state gate, so the
 * writer's permit is what keeps a caller waiting behind it cancellable.
 *
 * Within that order the boundary is atomic in both directions: a failure
 * before COMMIT rolls the SQL transaction back AND restores the memory
 * snapshot, and the memory snapshot is accepted exactly at SQL COMMIT,
 * through the `onCommit` callback registered before the body can queue any
 * publication. The gate is therefore already released when the journal runs
 * its post-commit work: compaction capture runs in a CHILD fiber and must see
 * a released gate, just as it sees a committed SQL transaction. Publication
 * failures happen after both commits and cannot undo either.
 *
 * `transact` defaults to the journal's own transaction. A caller passes its
 * own only to change how the writer's Exit is read, never to change the order.
