/**
 * Retention: the one operation that deletes finished run state.
 *
 * Nothing in the composition removed a `flows_runs` row or anything that hangs
 * off one. Every run a workspace ever finished stayed in `.flows/engine.db`
 * with its attempts, its persisted deferred completions and clock deadlines,
 * its journal entries, and its checkpoints, and journal compaction is off by
 * default (`SqlJournal` `Options.compaction`), so the file only grew. This
 * module is the deletion side, and the whole of it: one operation, run
 * explicitly.
 *
 * Three properties make it safe to run against a live workspace.
 *
 * - **One transaction.** Every delete runs inside a single `journal.transact`,
 *   so a crash leaves either a run with all of its rows or none of them —
 *   never a run row whose history is gone, or history whose run row is gone.
 * - **Terminal and aged only.** A run is a candidate only when its status is
 *   `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled` AND it finished before the cutoff.
 *   A running, pending, or suspended run is never a candidate at any age.
 * - **Nothing a live run still needs.** A candidate is retained when a live
 *   run stands on either side of it in the lineage, over BOTH relations that
 *   make one run the parent of another: the `flows_run_parents` edge a spawned
 *   child is recorded under, and the reserved `parent_run_id` column the
 *   rounds of one trampoline lineage are chained through. Upward: an aged
 *   terminal run with a live ancestor stays, because a parent reads a settled
 *   child's result out of its run row (`agent/await`) and a parent parked on
 *   an approval, a deferred, or a timer can be parked for longer than the
 *   threshold before it ever asks. Downward: an aged terminal run whose
 *   descendant is still live stays, because deleting it would leave that
 *   descendant's `parent_run_id` pointing at nothing and would drop the live
 *   descendant's lineage edges with the `flows_run_parents_gc` trigger.
 * - **Explicit.** Nothing schedules this. Automatic retention stays opt-in,
 *   for the reason `ArtifactGc` states: deletion is the irreversible
 *   direction, and a human approving a plan must be approving the deletions.
 *
 * Journal history is deleted outright rather than compacted to a checkpoint.
 * `Journal.checkpoint` and `Journal.compact` are owner-fenced — `SqlJournal`'s
 * `fenceGuard` requires a `flows_runs` row that is `running` under the exact
 * owner passed in — so neither can be called for a finished, ownerless run at
 * all. Deleting the run's entries and checkpoints is strictly stronger than
 * compacting them to a checkpoint, and it happens in the same transaction as
 * the run row, which is the property a compaction could not have given.
 *
 * The operation is idempotent. With a positive integer limit and a fixed,
 * finite, acyclic run lineage, each successful non-dry pass deletes at least
 * one collectable run until none remain. Continuation children are selected
 * before parents; parents pinned by excluded children do not consume the
 * bound. Runs protected by age or live lineage remain until eligible.

 * leaves `parent_run_id` NULL: the engine reserves that column for the rounds
 * of one trampoline lineage (`RunDriver.continueLineage`). The edge is the
 * relation every `agent/await` depends on. `link` is both relations as one
 * edge list.
 *
 * `under_live` is every run reachable downward from a run that is not
 * terminal. Those runs have a live ancestor, which can still read a settled
 * result out of their run row. `over_live` is every run reachable upward from
 * one. Those runs have a live descendant, whose own lineage the
 * `flows_run_parents_gc` trigger would drop with them. An edge whose parent
 * row is gone is not reachable from `live` at all, so it holds nothing back,
 * and since only terminal runs are ever deleted it never can.
 *
 * The walks carry run ids and nothing else, so `UNION` makes them terminate on
 * their own: a corrupt edge that closed a cycle adds a row the set already
 * holds, and the walk stops. That matters because these reads run inside the
 * pass's write transaction. They are SQLite-specific, like the `sqlite_master`
 * probe below, and rc.0 is SQLite-only.
 *
 * `parentEdges: false` drops the `flows_run_parents` half of `link`. A
 * database that carries the run rows but not the engine's edge table — the
 * control plane's, which migrates the run store and the journal and nothing
 * else — has no edges to walk, and reading the missing table would fail the
