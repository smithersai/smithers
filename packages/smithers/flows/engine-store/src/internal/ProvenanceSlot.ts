 * row was served, this replay failed — so a re-emission after a resume or in
 * a fork child records the same fact with fresh measurements (`ageMs`, the
 * clock, a later `reason`) and collapses onto the row already there. That

 * same event type, the same key, the same action, and the same recorded row
 * when the record names one. Anything else in the slot is the conflict the
 * journal reported.
