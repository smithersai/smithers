/**
 * Encoding a round's settlement so a terminal transition can never be lost.
 *
 * A run row leaves `running` only when the driver has bytes to write into
 * `state_json`, and those bytes come from the flow's OWN codec:
 * `Flow.Result({ success: flow.successSchema, error: flow.errorSchema })`.
 * A flow that declares `Schema.Unknown` for either channel — which is what
 * `@smthrs/agent`'s `agent/run` declares, because an agent run carries
 * whatever its body failed with — encodes that channel through `Schema.Json`,
 * and `Schema.Json` rejects every class instance: `SchemaAST.isJson` walks the
 * prototype chain and refuses anything that is not a plain object or an array.
 * Every `Data.TaggedError` in this repository is therefore unencodable through
 * such a flow, `HarnessError` and `ModelError` included.
 *
 * Guarding the terminal transition with `Effect.orDie` around that encode made
 * an unencodable failure fatal for the drain instead of terminal for the run.
 * The release validation caught the whole chain: `engine-store: coordinated
 * drain failed for run-1 SchemaError: Expected JSON value at
 * ["exit"]["cause"][0]["error"]`, `engine.db` `flows_runs` left at `running`
 * with a dead owner pid while `control.db` said `failed`, and 86 seconds later
 * the next process's stale-running sweep stole the row, opened a second turn,
 * and billed the provider seat again for a run the control plane had closed.
 *
 * So the encode fails CLOSED here rather than open. The ordinary path is the
 * flow's own codec, unchanged. When that codec rejects the value, the result
 * is still written — as a JSON projection of what could not be encoded (tag,
 * code, message, a stack summary, and nested causes) inside a `Die` reason —
 * and the caller is told, through {@link EncodedResult.note}, that it must
 * settle the run `failed`. A settled run is never re-executed, which is the
 * durability promise the release policy states as one terminal write.
 *
 * The projection is built as plain JSON rather than re-encoded through a
 * schema, so nothing in this module can raise. Its top-level object carries no
 * `message` key on purpose: `Schema.Defect` revives any JSON object that has a
 * string `message` as an `Error`, and a projection has to come back out of the
 * row as the structured record it went in as.
