     * The decision is emitted only for a `Transitioned` outcome — a lost CAS
     * changed nothing, and its `claim-lost`/`activation-lost` records are
     * emitted by the caller, outside the transaction, so they survive.

     *

     *   requests it. Nothing more is needed here.
     * - Cancellation first. The cascade walked `flows_run_parents` while the
     *   edge did not exist yet, so it could not have seen this child — and
     *   the parent's drive may already be gone, so nothing will walk the
     *   edge table again on its behalf. The child would be created fresh and
     *   uncancelled, and would run to completion under a cancelled parent.
     *
     * The second order is closed by reading the parent row inside the SAME
     * outer storage transaction that recorded the edge and created the child
     * row, after the child row exists. Either the cancellation transaction
     * committed before this read, in which case the request is visible here
     * and is inherited atomically with the child's own creation, or it has
     * not committed yet, in which case it commits after this transaction and
     * its own cascade sees the edge. There is no third interleaving, so no
     * ephemeral hand-off flag and no timing-based retry is involved. The
     * argument rests on two things: the store's serialized writes, and the
     * order inside `requestCancelDescendants` — a cancellation marks its own
     * run before it walks the edge table, which is what keeps the two sides
     * from missing each other even where `DurableEngineState.transaction` is
     * the in-memory pass-through and only the run-row writes serialize.
     *
     * Nesting falls out of this: the inherited request is written to the
     * child's own row, so a grandchild admitted later reads a cancel-requested
     * parent and inherits in turn.
     *
     * `requestCancel` is unfenced and first-writer-wins, so a repeated
     * admission writes nothing the second time; a parent row that is gone,
     * or one with no rounds at all, inherits nothing. Both ways a parent can
     * exit are inherited here, and they differ in whether the child's own
     * `onParentExit` can spare it. An explicit cancellation in ANY round is
     * inherited unconditionally, whether it is a pending
     * `cancel_requested_at_ms` or a round already settled terminally
     * `cancelled` whose request column a compaction could have cleared. A
     * parent that instead stopped normally, with EVERY round `completed` or
     * `failed`, cancels a late child that was admitted attached and leaves an
     * `onParentExit === "detach"` child to outlive it.
     *
     * The child does not need its own cascade here: it was just created, so
     * it has no descendants of its own, and once it observes the inherited
     * request `cancelOwned` cascades from it like any other cancellation.
