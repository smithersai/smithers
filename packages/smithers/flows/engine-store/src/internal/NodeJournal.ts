 * record's own `sourceId`, typed by the payload schemas `@smthrs/journal`
 * publishes, and carrying the same event types the plan scheduler writes so a
 * reader folds both executors with one decoder.
 *
 * Two facts live here rather than in the interpreter. The journal's producer
 * identity is `(runId, sourceId, sourceSeq)`, so a resumed walk that
 * re-derives the same `sourceId` collapses onto the row the first walk wrote:
 * that is the exactly-once contract, and it holds because the identity is the
 * record's, never a fresh one minted per observation. And a declaration site
 * is made repo-relative here, because only the writer knows the root: a
 * journal is read on machines that did not write it, and an absolute path is
 * at best noise and at worst an operator's home directory published into a
 * run's history.
