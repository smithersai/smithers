 *
 * The reduction reads only own data-property descriptors. It never invokes a

 * its bytes and attached properties are deliberately omitted. JSON leaves,
 * arrays, and enumerable string-keyed object data otherwise keep their ordinary
 * JSON shape. Unsupported object members are omitted and unsupported array
 * members become `null`, matching JSON's container rules. Every key returned
 * by an own-key enumeration spends from a cause-wide allowance before its type,
 * enumerability, or descriptor is inspected.
 *
 * Depth, node, and character bounds apply before the attempt store's admission
 * boundary, and `budget` carries the allowances across every reason of one
 * cause. The caller charges the root value as part of its reason envelope; this
 * walk charges every descendant. A cycle, proxy, inspection refusal, or
 * exceeded bound rejects the whole value as `null`, so persistence on the
