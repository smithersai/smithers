/**
 * Effect-boundary evidence, emitted by the engine at the point an irreversible
 * action crosses into the outside world.
 *
 * `docs/pages/concepts/time-travel.md` requires one durable
 * journal entry recorded **before the adapter begins**, whose status then moves
 * only forward (`intended` → `succeeded` | `unknown`). Rewind reads exactly
 * these records to classify the doomed suffix as blocking, revertible, or
 * warning; nothing else in the journal can answer that question, because an
 * attempt row says an attempt happened, not that an effect left the machine.
 *
 * ## Why the shape lives here and not in `@smthrs/time-travel`
 *
 * `@smthrs/time-travel` depends on `@smthrs/engine-store` (it decodes
 * `RunState`), so the arrow cannot be reversed without a cycle. The record is
 * therefore a **wire contract**, not a shared type: this module writes the
 * shape `EffectBoundary.decodeEntry` reads, under the event type that module
 * owns, and `packages/smithers/flows/time-travel/test/EngineIntegration.test.ts` pins the two
 * together by rewinding across a boundary record this module produced.
 *
 * ## One producer identity, two channels that must not double-count
 *
 * An irreversible dispatch now writes on two channels: the attempt lifecycle
 * (`attempt-started` / `attempt-finished`), which says a durable attempt row
 * moved, and this boundary (`intended` / terminal), which says an external
 * effect was begun and how it settled. They are deliberately NOT merged —
 * an attempt is retried under new numbers while an effect keeps one identity —
 * and they cannot double-count, because a rewind's suffix scan matches only
 * {@link eventType}. The two are tied by construction: the effect id IS the
 * attempt identity (`runId:keyDigest:attempt`), so every boundary record names
 * the attempt row that produced it and the audit reads as one story.
