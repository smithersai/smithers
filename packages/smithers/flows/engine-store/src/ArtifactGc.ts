/**
 * Mark/sweep garbage collection for the content-addressed artifact store.
 *
 * The artifact tier is the one store in the composition with true *garbage*:
 * every output over the inline bound is spilled to `.flows/objects` by digest
 * (`StepBoundary`), nothing ever deletes a published blob, and a blob whose
 * every referencing row is gone is unreachable forever. The step cache is
 * deliberately NOT collected here — its rows are the *roots* of this graph,
 * they never become unreachable, and removing one is the policy decision
 * `CacheStore.evict` already serves.
 *
 * The design combines the two prior arts on the shelf:
 *
 * - **Reachability from durable roots** — git's `git gc` marks from refs;
 *   Skyframe deletes what a keyed graph walk cannot reach. Here the roots are
 *   every attempt row of every existing (never-deleted) run and every step
 *   cache entry; each carries boundary evidence, and
 *   `StepBoundary.referencedDigests` names the blobs that evidence needs.
 *   Attempt checkpoints are roots too: they are opaque executable state, so
 *   the mark keeps digest-shaped strings found in their JSON.
 * - **A grace period over mtime** — git refuses to prune unreachable objects
 *   younger than `gc.pruneExpire` (two weeks), jj keeps operations newer than
 *   its keep bound, and Bazel's disk-cache collector
 *   (`reference/bazel/.../remote/disk/DiskCacheGarbageCollector.java`) fences
 *   on mtime. The cutoff is the collection start time minus the grace period,
 *   sampled before resolving policy pins or scanning roots and held fixed
 *   through inventory and deletion. Only mtimes strictly before it are
 *   eligible: a blob published — or freshened by a dedupe `put` — at or after
 *   collection start survives, including same-millisecond writes at zero
 *   grace, no lock required.
 *
 * Collection NEVER runs automatically. `gc()` is an explicit verb because
 * deletion is irreversible, and a human approving a plan must approve the
 * deletions too. The opt-in {@link ArtifactGcPolicy} layer
 * configures *how* an invocation collects (grace bound, pinned digests); it
 * does not schedule anything.

 *
 * The mark phase reads `flows_step_cache` and `flows_attempts` directly, the

 * composes every one of those migrations, so the schema is its own. Every run
 * present in `flows_runs` is a live root — there is no deleted state, and the
 * attempt table's foreign key guarantees each attempt's run exists — so the
 * scan is simply *all* attempt rows plus *all* cache entries, paged by
 * primary key so no page holds more than `pageSize` rows in memory.
 *
 * Ordering is the safety argument. The live set is computed BEFORE the
 * inventory, so a root recorded during the sweep can only be missed, never
 * half-seen — and the blob such a root references is protected anyway: a
 * fresh publication carries a fresh mtime, a re-publication of existing bytes
 * freshens the blob's mtime (`ArtifactStore.put`), and the sweep's deletion
 * is fenced on that mtime (`ArtifactSweep.remove`'s `ifUnmodifiedSinceMs`).
 * A crash mid-sweep deletes some garbage and no live blobs; re-running
 * converges.
