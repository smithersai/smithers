/**
 * Deleting run history that has outlived its usefulness.
 *
 * Nothing in the durable stores forgets on its own: a finished run keeps its
 * row, every attempt, every journal event, and every archived frame forever.
 * That is the right default — a run's history is the only account of what an
 * agent did to a repository — and it is why `smithers gc` exists rather than a
 * background sweeper. Retention is an operator decision, taken explicitly,
 * with a dry run available before anything is deleted.
 *
 * This module is the public surface. The operation lives in
 * `internal/RetentionOps.ts` beside the other modules that read this package's
 * own tables, so `internal/` is never imported by a consumer — the same split
 * `Errors.ts` uses. {@link retain} and {@link layer} are that operation: one
 * bounded pass over the engine ladder, inside one `journal.transact`.
 *
 * {@link collect} is the host-facing pass `smithers gc` runs, and it is a
 * facade over the same guard. A project keeps its history in two files — the
 * control plane's database and the engine's — and a sweep of one without the
 * other leaves half of a deleted run behind, so the pass takes the database as
 * a service and runs once per file. Which runs it may delete is
 * {@link RetentionOps.lineagePrelude}'s answer, not a second guard written
 * here: a run stays whenever a live run stands above or below it, over BOTH
 * relations that make one run the parent of another — the `flows_run_parents`
 * edge a spawned child records, and the `parent_run_id` column a trampoline
 * lineage is chained through.
 *
 * Only terminal runs are ever considered. A `pending`, `running`, or
 * `suspended` row belongs to work that can still resume.

 * `parent_run_id` foreign key refuses. A handoff parent always sorts before
 * its successor, so deleting in age order broke as soon as one lineage
 * straddled a chunk boundary, and it broke AFTER the dependent rows of every
 * eligible run were already gone. `assumeLadder: false` because this pass also
 * runs against the control plane's database, which composed fewer stores.
 *
 * Eligibility and deletion share one retryable transaction: another writer
 * cannot attach a live parent between the lineage scan and deletion. A busy
 * retry recomputes eligibility rather than replaying an old candidate list.
 * One transaction, for the reason `retain` opens one: a pass that removed a
 * run's history and then refused on its row would have destroyed what it could
 * not put back, and a workspace whose next pass refuses the same way can never
 * be collected again.
 *
 * Under `dryRun` nothing is written and `deleted` is empty: the report names
 * exactly the runs a real pass would remove, which is what makes
 * `smithers gc --dry-run` worth trusting.
