/**
 * The shared step-result tier's publication seam: the remote half of a cache
 * `put`, run *after* the transaction that made the local row durable.
 *
 * `ArtifactSync` is the same idea for the artifact tier, and the two together
 * are the REAPI ordering constraint
 * (`reference/bazel/.../remote/UploadManifest.java:630-633`): blobs first, the
 * entry that references them last.
 *
 * This tag exists because of *where* the local row is written.
 * `ActionPersistence` commits the cache row and the journal record that
 * explains it in one `DurableWriter` transaction, and nothing that is not
 * storage work may be held across one — the action body, the Jj snapshot, and
 * the boundary prepare/settle all already stay outside. A `CacheStore` whose
 * `put` also writes a shared HTTP tier would put a network round trip inside
 * that transaction, blocking every other writer for its duration and rolling
 * the local row back when a *shared cache* is unreachable. So the local put
 * stays inside and the shared put becomes this service, invoked once the
 * transaction has committed. Compose it with
 * `CombinedCacheStore` in `"deferred"` publication mode, which is the mode that
 * leaves the shared write to this seam.
 *
 * Publication is **best-effort by construction**. A shared cache is an
 * accelerator, and the work it would have shared is already durably recorded on
 * this host: failing a completed run because an optional tier is unreachable
 * trades a real result for an unavailable one. A refused publication is
 * journaled by the caller instead, which is the same treatment an unverified
 * read set gets — visible, not silent.
 *
 * Governing design: `packages/smithers/flows/step-cache/docs/api.md`.
