 * Decodes the rows one durable-state sweep read, skipping — with a

 *
 * Decoding the batch through `Effect.orDie` made one malformed row fatal for
 * every row beside it: `completedDeferreds` and `pendingClocks` are what
 * `register` sweeps, so a single unreadable row anywhere in a flow's history
 * killed every registration of that flow, and no run of it ever resumed again.
 * The blast radius of a corrupt row must be that row. The key is logged
 * because it is what an operator needs to find and repair it, and it is read
 * field by field off the raw row so a row that failed to decode can still name
 * itself.
 *
 * Every enumeration goes through here for that reason, not just the two the
 * outage named: `dueClocks`, `waitingRuns`, `runParents`, and `runChildren`
 * each had their own version of it — no timer in the store fires, no parked
 * run is ever swept, no cycle check can read a run's ancestry, no
 * cancellation reaches a child.
 *
 * The point reads (`deferred`, `clock`, `waiting`) deliberately stay on
 * `Effect.orDie`. They answer a question about ONE row, and their callers
 * read "no row" as "this never happened": silently reporting that for a
 * completion or deadline that is durably recorded but unreadable would
 * re-run work whose side effects already ran. There the corrupt row IS the
 * blast radius, so dying is the correct-sized failure.
