/**
 * Durable engine schema migrations.
 *
 * Engine-store owns persisted deferred/clock state, execution selections,
 * and append-only plan-input observations. These are authoritative execution
 * records, distinct from journal projections and evictable step-cache rows.
 * It reserves migration id block `3000`.
 *
 * Because engine-store composes the journal, the run store, and the step
 * cache, {@link sets} is also the full durable schema an engine needs, and
 * {@link layer} installs it in dependency order.
 *
 * Derived contracts: `docs/api.md` ("Migrations") and
 * `packages/smithers/flows/journal/docs/api.md`.
