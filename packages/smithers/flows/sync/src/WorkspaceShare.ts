/**
 * Workspace share capabilities: the credential a sync connection presents to
 * read the workspace's non-branch runs.
 *
 * The scheme extends the branch share shape rather than inventing a parallel
 * one: a claim set and an HMAC-SHA-256 signature over its length-prefixed
 * canonical encoding, verified with a constant-time comparison. Two things
 * are added. A `kid` names the signing key inside the claims, so keys rotate
 * without invalidating capabilities minted under a retired key that is still
 * in the verification keyring. And the canonical encoding starts with a
 * scheme label, so a workspace capability can never verify as a branch
 * capability even if one secret is misconfigured into both authorities.
 *
 * Secrets enter through {@link Key} as `Redacted` values — a keyring never
 * holds a plain string — and {@link layerConfig} provisions the keyring from
 * configuration without any secret appearing in code.
