/**
 * Share capabilities: the authorization boundary of a shared branch.
 *
 * A share link carries a capability, not a session. The capability names
 * exactly one branch, one access level, and one expiry, and it is signed, so
 * the holder cannot widen it. Every branch operation authorizes through
 * `verify`, which is therefore the single place cross-branch access and
 * expired links are refused.
 *
 * The signature is HMAC-SHA-256 over a length-prefixed encoding of the claims,
 * led by a scheme label. Length prefixes matter: without them a branch id
 * ending in the separator could be re-cut into a different, still-validly-
 * signed claim set. The label matters for the same reason across schemes: a
 * branch capability can never verify as a workspace capability even if one
 * secret is misconfigured into both authorities. Web Crypto is used directly
 * so the same module runs in the browser and on node.
 *
 * A `kid` inside the claims names the key that signed them, so a branch secret
 * rotates the way the workspace secret already did: the new key signs, the
 * retired key stays in the verification keyring, and the share links already
 * out keep working until they expire.
