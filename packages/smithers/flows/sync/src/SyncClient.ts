/**
 * Projects a Sync RPC client into the local replication service.
 *
 * Delivered and applied cursors are separate per-service `Ref` maps: concurrent
 * subscriptions for one materialization share them, and each commit advances
 * its matching map monotonically. A
 * cursor advances in the same stream pull that admits each entry to the
 * consumer, or — when the caller supplies `SubscribeOptions.apply` — only
 * after that callback has applied the entry. Interrupted partial pages
 * therefore retain the last admitted entry rather than incorrectly
 * acknowledging the server's whole page.
 *
 * A frame or bootstrap page whose encoded entries exceed `maxFrameBytes` is
 * refused with `frame_too_large`. Out-of-scope entries, repeated or reordered
 * sequences, and missing response generations fail with `protocol_violation`
 * before delivery. Each entry-bearing run in a Read page must have exactly one
 * explicit generation cursor, and every entry must be above the requested
 * cursor. Live frames instead drop already-covered entries and deliver only
 * the suffix above the cursor. An incomplete bootstrap page with no entries
 * or a completed subscription window with no frames fails with
 * `protocol_violation` instead of reopening immediately.
 *
 * A live follow that loses its transport reconnects under
 * {@link reconnectPolicy}, resuming from the acknowledged cursors; the failure
 * cause is logged before the retry folds it. The follow spends a credit window
 * of {@link defaultCredit} frames per subscription round and replenishes it by
 * resubscribing from the cursors it has acknowledged. Already-covered entries
 * are not delivered again; the round-trip cost scales with credit windows.
 *
 * A `compacted` refusal fails closed unless `SubscribeOptions.onResync`
 * restores the missing prefix and returns its exact cursor. Snapshot fetching
 * never applies state or advances cursors. Only a validated receipt for the requested run at or
 * above its compaction floor advances the cursor before reading the suffix.
 *
 * A subscription's effective cursor per run is the LATER of the caller's and
 * the matching progress map: a caller that restored its own progress is never
 * regressed, and a caller asking for history this client already acknowledged
 * is fast-forwarded. Rebuild a projection from an earlier position with a
 * fresh client, whose acknowledged map is empty.
