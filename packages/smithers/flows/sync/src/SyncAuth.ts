/**
 * The sync read path's connection authentication: implementations of the
 * `SyncRpcs.SyncAuth` RPC middleware.
 *
 * A connection presents a {@link WorkspaceShare.WorkspaceCapability} in the
 * {@link capabilityHeader} request header. {@link layer} verifies it against
 * the workspace's {@link WorkspaceShare.WorkspaceShare} authority and runs
 * the handler as the workspace principal. A request with no header runs as
 * the anonymous principal — branch share capabilities carried in request
 * payloads still authorize branch reads — and the server refuses anonymous
 * access to every non-branch run. A request whose header is present but
 * malformed, forged, expired, or signed by an unknown key is refused
 * outright: presence of a credential is a claim, and a false claim is never
 * downgraded to anonymity.
 *
 * There is deliberately no trusted pass-through implementation here: the only
 * sanctioned bypass is an in-process caller providing `SyncPrincipal` itself,
 * never a transport.
