/**
 * The read path over an already-validated policy.
 *
 * A read SHARES its page across the runs it covers and stops at the first of
 * three bounds: the request's `limit`, the frame ceiling, or the durable tail
 * of every covered run, which is the only case that reports `done: true`.
 * Every covered run takes a share of the budget before any run takes a second
 * helping, and what the shares leave unspent is offered back in run order, so
 * a run with a backlog still takes the larger part of a page but never all of
 * it. Filling in run order instead let a producer that stayed one page ahead
 * take every slot of every page: `done` never became true, so a bootstrapping
 * follower never reached the runs behind it and never reached the live follow
 * either. The frame ceiling is a page budget, not a verdict on the read:
 * entries are served until the next one would cross it, and the page then
 * reports `done: false` so the follower asks for the rest. Only a SINGLE
 * entry whose own encoded size exceeds the ceiling is refused with
 * `frame_too_large`, because no page can ever carry it.
 *
 * A workspace subscription's fan-out is bounded without bounding what it
 * serves. Each round reconciles the runs it covers against `RunCatalog.list`,
 * then reads ONE bounded page per run, at most `Options.concurrency` reads
 * open at once. A run with more waiting wakes the next round rather than
 * holding its slot, so no run is starved by a run that stays busy. A round
 * repeats on a journal entry committed in this process, on a catalog
 * announcement, on a run that reported more, or after
 * `Options.tailIntervalMs`. A wake for an entry committed in this process
 * reads only the runs that entry named; a round that re-lists the catalog
 * reads every covered run, so the bound caps what is open at once while a
 * round's work and the positions a follower keeps grow with the runs it
 * covers. The interval is the freshness policy for the runs another process
 * owns, not for the runs written beside the follower. A run-scoped
 * subscription follows that one run's journal stream directly and keeps its
 * in-process wake.
 *
 * Authorization is fail-closed along two boundaries, both consulted per
 * request:
 *
 * - Branch runs: a run whose id maps to a shared branch is visible only when
 *   the request's share capability verifies for that branch. An explicitly
 *   scoped branch read without one fails; a workspace listing excludes branch
 *   runs the caller's capability does not cover, so one share link never
 *   leaks another branch's log. Without a {@link BranchShare} in scope every
 *   branch run is closed.
 * - Non-branch runs: visible only to the workspace principal
 *   (`SyncPrincipal`), whose default is anonymous. A workspace-scoped
 *   request and a run-scoped request for a non-branch run are both refused
 *   for anonymous callers, so a connection with no credential — or with only
 *   a branch share link — can never read engine runs.
 *
 * A SUBSCRIPTION is additionally bounded in time: it ends with `unauthorized`
 * when the credential that opened it expires, because a stream authorized
 * once at open is otherwise the one thing a signed expiry cannot revoke.
