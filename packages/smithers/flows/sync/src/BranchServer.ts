/**
 * The server-side handlers of {@link BranchRpcs}: a thin projection of the
 * branch services onto the wire.
 *
 * Five procedures forward to the service that owns their boundary and add
 * nothing: `Branch.Submit` to {@link BranchCommands}, and `Branch.Announce`,
 * `Branch.Leave`, `Branch.Roster`, and `Branch.WatchRoster` to
 * {@link BranchPresence}. Two enforce policy here, on top of what
 * {@link BranchShare} checks: `Branch.CreateBranch` refuses any principal that
 * is not an authenticated workspace, and `Branch.MintShare` verifies write
 * access, refuses an expired parent, and caps the child at the parent's
 * expiry. `BranchShare.mint` performs none of those checks, so an in-process
 * host that mints through the service directly must gate the principal and
 * the parent capability itself.

/**
 * Provides the branch RPC handlers over the branch services.
 *
 * A roster watch emits the roster as of subscription, then re-lists on every
 * presence change for the branch AND once per `presence.leaseMs`, emitting
 * only when the roster it read differs from the one it last sent.
 *
 * All three of those are triggers into ONE sequential reader. The roster is
 * mutable state behind an effect, so concurrent readers can complete out of
 * order, and a watcher that receives an older roster after a newer one keeps
 * the older one: `changesWith` compares against the previous emission, not
 * against the freshest state. Serializing the reads is what makes the last
 * value a watcher holds the most recent one that was read.
 *
 * The periodic re-list is what makes expiry observable. A lapsed lease
 * publishes nothing — the roster drops it the next time somebody lists — so a
 * watch driven by change events alone never saw the LAST participant leave,
 * and a burst of announcements on unrelated branches could slide the one
 * notification this watch needed out of the shared feed. Both are bounded by
 * one lease now: a departure is visible within `leaseMs` of it happening,
 * whether or not a survivor reports it.
