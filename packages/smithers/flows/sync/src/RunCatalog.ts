 * host's catalog, because both fan-out paths key a run's served position by
 * run id: a run named twice is read twice from the same position and its
 * entries are served twice.
 *
 * The catalog is supplied by the host rather than derived from the journal:
 * `@smthrs/journal` has no workspace-wide list or watch contract, and
 * `@smthrs/engine-store` owns the durable run set that {@link makePolling}
 * reads.

 *
 * The catalog primes itself before it returns, so the first read a follower
 * makes is already current and a workspace that cannot be read at all fails
 * the composition instead of serving an empty run set. After that a failed
 * read is a warning and nothing else: the previous view stands, the interval
 * holds, and no subscription attached to the catalog is torn down for it.
 * The warning is written once per outage, with the first failure's cause, and
 * one info line marks the read that ends it; the polls in between are silent.
 *
 * A run is announced once, when it first appears. A run the read stops
 * naming, which is what retention collecting it looks like, leaves the view;
 * `list` is the workspace's run set, not a log of every run it ever had.
 *
 * `list` answers with a fresh array each time, matching {@link layerStatic} and

 * splice the authoritative run set in place under the poll fiber that owns it,
 * which is a defect a `ReadonlyArray` type hides from TypeScript and not from
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * The poll fiber belongs to the caller's scope. Closing the scope stops it.
 *
