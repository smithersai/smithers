/**
 * Idempotent admission of collaborative commands onto a branch document.
 *
 * Three different things look identical from the server's side — an optimistic
 * client re-sending after a timeout, a reconnecting client flushing its
 * outbox, and two people pressing the same button at once — and all three must
 * produce exactly one durable command. The client-minted `commandId` is the
 * idempotency key for all three.
 *
 * The exactly-once constraint is durable, not process-local: every append
 * carries the producer identity `(branch run, commandSourceId(commandId),
 * commandSourceSeq)`, which the journal enforces inside its own write
 * transaction. Two independently constructed servers that race the same
 * command therefore collide in the journal — one appends, the other receives
 * a duplicate receipt or an idempotency conflict and resolves the canonical
 * sequence by replaying the branch (audit finding F-14). The in-memory
 * ledger, permit, and replay cursor are a fast path only: they answer known
 * duplicates without a journal write and keep a restarted server from
 * re-executing history, but correctness never depends on them.
