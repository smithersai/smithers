 * workspace principal supplied by the group's {@link SyncAuth} middleware,
 * and its handler refuses any other principal.
 *
 * Every later procedure carries its own share capability and authorizes
 * through {@link BranchShare}: past the bootstrap the capability IS the
 * credential, and cross-branch or expired capabilities are refused by the
 * same service boundary the in-process callers use.
