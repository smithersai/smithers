/**
 * Retention bounds on the two in-process change feeds.
 *
 * `RunCatalog.changes` and `BranchPresence.changes` are notification streams,
 * not logs: a follower reads them to learn that something moved and then reads
 * the authoritative state. Both were built on `PubSub.unbounded`, so a
 * subscriber that stops pulling — a disconnected browser tab whose socket has
 * not timed out, a follower blocked on a slow consumer — made the process
 * retain every announcement made since it stalled, without bound. These cases
 * pin the sliding bound: the stalled subscriber loses the oldest
 * announcements instead, and the publisher never grows on its behalf.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
