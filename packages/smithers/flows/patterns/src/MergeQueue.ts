 * Builds the landing topology: the members in queue order, batched into
 * `Node.all` groups of `concurrency` members, with the batches sequenced.
 *
 * At the default concurrency of 1 the queue is a plain `Node.andThen` chain,
 * with no `Node.all` at all, so the declared plan admits exactly one landing at
 * a time. Each call carries `{ id, position, input }`, so a built graph names
 * each member's place in the queue.
 *
 * A member's effective priority reaches the plan as a `Node.priority`
 * annotation rather than as call input, which is what lets the scheduler start
 * the higher-priority ready landing first. Priority stays out of key material,
 * so raising a member's number without changing the resulting order re-uses the
 * same steps rather than re-landing the queue.
 *
 * `failurePolicy` picks the topology. Under `quarantine` every member gains a
 * recovery arm settling it as MergeQueue's `Quarantined` result, so a failing
 * member neither fails the chain nor interrupts the batch beside it: the
 * queue {@link run} lands. Under `halt` the chain has no continuation past a
 * failed member, and it is always the serial chain: a halting queue is refused
 * above concurrency 1, because a batch would start a member behind a failure
 * before the failure is known.
 *
 * Every landing settles to a tagged outcome, and one final map folds them in
 * queue order into the same {@link Result} {@link run} returns:
 * `{ landed, quarantined, order }`.
 *
 * `make` throws a `PatternError` when there are no members, when two members
 * share an id, when `concurrency` is not a positive safe integer, when
 * `failurePolicy` is `halt` and `concurrency` is above 1, or when `priority`
 * is not a safe integer.
 *
 * `make` snapshots `members`, each member's `id`, `flow`, and `priority`, and

 * behind it lands, which is why `halt` runs only at concurrency 1: a wider

 * `run` fails with a `PatternError` for `halt` above concurrency 1, before

 * `{ id, error }`, untagged, because `landed` and `quarantined` are separate
 * arrays.
 *
 * Both policies read the typed failure channel. A member that throws raises a
 * defect, which fails the queue under either policy and cancels the landings
 * still in flight.
