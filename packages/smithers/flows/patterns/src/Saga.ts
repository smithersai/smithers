 * Runs the forward chain, unwinding completed steps on a failure or an

 * ran to the end returns {@link Completed} with its step values nested under
 * `values`, and a clean unwind under `compensate` returns
 * {@link Compensated}.
 *
 * Each completed step registers a scope finalizer, so the unwind is LIFO and
 * runs on interruption as well as on failure. A compensation that fails does
 * not stop the ones behind it; every failing step id is collected and the run
 * fails `PatternError { code: "compensation_failed" }` naming them, because
 * state left dirty outranks the failure that started the unwind.
 *
 * A compensation that DIES counts as a failed compensation, not as a defect
 * the run raises: the undo did not happen, so the step belongs in the residue
 * with the typed failures. This includes a synchronous throw while constructing
 * the compensation effect. Letting the defect escape would lose both the
 * residue and the failure that started the unwind.
