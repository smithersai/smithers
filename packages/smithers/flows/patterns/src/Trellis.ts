/**
 * Model-authored bounded delegation plans.
 *
 * A model returns a plan of nested `agent`, `sequence`, and `parallel` nodes.
 * This module validates that plan against an {@link Envelope}, compiles it into
 * ordinary flow calls, and executes it with bounded concurrency.
 *
 * `Recursion.recurse` needs a literal tree while the graph is being planned.
 * A Trellis plan is discovered at run time instead, so the two halves are
 * deliberately separate. {@link make} declares the conservative topology the
 * plan can never exceed, one leaf call per fuel unit. {@link run} executes the
 * plan a model actually authored. A durable host spends one
 * trampoline round per authored plan, handing off with the `To` outcome
 * `@smthrs/flow` defines, so each round is its own journal segment and a crash
 * resumes at the round boundary.
