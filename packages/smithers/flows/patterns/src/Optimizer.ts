/**
 * Generate, evaluate, improve: a bounded search for a candidate that reaches a
 * target score.
 *
 * The optimizer is {@link Loop} plus two things a loop does not have: a score
 * threshold as its predicate, and a best-so-far ledger, because the last
 * candidate a search produces is often not its best one. Every iteration hands
 * the previous candidate's score and feedback to the next generation, which is
 * what makes the search a search rather than a retry.
 *
 * This pattern scores one candidate with one evaluator. A search that scores
 * candidates against a fixed suite belongs above the pattern layer, in the
 * caller that owns the suite.
