/**
 * Bounded repeat-until-predicate loops.
 *
 * A loop is the one control-flow shape a plan cannot represent honestly: the
 * number of rounds is a runtime fact. This module answers that the same way
 * `ReviewLoop` answers it. {@link make} unrolls the declared bound into a
 * conservative topology, declaring every iteration a run could reach so that
 * capability and conflict analysis see the worst case. {@link run} performs the
 * value-dependent stop, short-circuiting the moment the predicate is
 * satisfied.
 *
 * For a loop whose rounds must survive a crash, hand each iteration to the
 * durable trampoline instead: `Flow.to` with `maxRounds`, described in the
 * loops reference at https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/api/patterns.
