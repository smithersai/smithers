 * per-item chain across columns rather than a column-wide barrier of values.
 * The flow settles to the {@link Board} of its one pass, the record {@link run}
 * returns with `iterations: 1`. `onComplete` receives `{ items, board }` and
 * its own answer is discarded, as in `run`.
 * The columns themselves are sequenced: a column's first call depends on the

 * duplicate item id, duplicate column name, or a concurrency that is not a

 * each item record, so a later edit to the caller's arrays or records does
 * not change the declaration.
 *
 * A column joins its batch with {@link Quarantine.all} under the `quarantine`
 * policy, because one rejected card is not a reason to interrupt the cards
 * beside it, which is the same call {@link run} makes. A rejected card
 * settles as a {@link Quarantine.Quarantined} marker naming the item.
 *
 * A later column's call for a card is the live arm of a `Node.branch` on the
 * real set of rejected cards, so a card an earlier column rejected makes no
 * further call, exactly as in `run`. The declared call count is therefore an
 * upper bound on a pass, and the calls an executed declaration makes are the

 * so a port that relied on the default must pass `maxIterations: 5`. `until`
 * stops the board early after the pass whose result satisfies the predicate. Each pass starts from an empty board, and the
 * returned board is the last pass's.
 *
