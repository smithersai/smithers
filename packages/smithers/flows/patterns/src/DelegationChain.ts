/**
 * The fixed delegation chain: refine, plan, derisk, execute, review, settle.
 *
 * Nothing here is new machinery. The chain is assembled from the patterns that
 * already exist: {@link ReviewLoop} runs the derisk rounds, {@link Trellis}
 * admits and executes the derisked plan, {@link Escalation} walks the tier
 * ladder weakest first, and {@link WithRetry} spends the per-tier attempts.
 * This module owns the order those parts run in and the bounds they run under.
 *
 * {@link make} declares what {@link run} executes: every tier call it declares
 * carries the same `Work` a tier is run with, every leaf review carries the
 * tier that produced the output, and settle carries the keys `run` settles
 * with. The one payload that still differs is inside the derisk loop, which
 * `ReviewLoop` owns: it reviews with the produced plan and revises with
 * `{ output, review, round }`, while `run` names the goal and the round in both.
