/**
 * Bounded retry helpers.
 *
 * The declared decorator performs the retry: every attempt the budget allows
 * is a call of the wrapped flow, each attempt but the last is guarded by a
 * `Node.catch` whose failure arm runs the next one, and a declared backoff is a
 * durable `Sleep.action` wait between them. {@link retryEffect} performs the
 * same policy on a hand-written Effect. The ladder IS `@smthrs/flow`
 * `RetryPolicy`'s, so a pattern policy and an engine policy are the same three
 * numbers rather than two spellings of them.
