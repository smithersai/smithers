/**
 * Capture the world, compare it to a baseline, and alert when it moved.

 * Drift detection is the shape behind config auditing, index freshness, and
 * dependency pinning: one capture, one comparison against a remembered state,
 * and an action taken only when the comparison says something changed.
 *
 * The pattern detects once. Polling belongs to the caller, because how often
 * to look is a deployment decision rather than a property of the check: wrap
 * {@link run} in `Loop.run` for bounded rounds inside one execution. The recipe
 * is in the loops reference at https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/api/patterns.
