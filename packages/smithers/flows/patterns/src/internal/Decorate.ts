/**
 * What a decorator reads off a `@smthrs/flow` declaration, and how it
 * re-declares one.
 *
 * A decorator is the one thing in this package that does not merely CALL a
 * member: it takes a whole declaration apart and states a new one with the same
 * schemas and a narrowed authority. `@smthrs/core` carried a flow's capability
 * ceiling and effect envelope as literal fields, so reading them was a property
 * access; `@smthrs/flow` carries both in the annotation bag, under the keys
 * `Graph.build` itself consults. This module is where that difference lives, so
 * `Pattern`, `WithApproval`, `WithCache` and `WithRetry` state a wrapper the
 * same way.
 *
 * The envelope algebra it narrows with is `Compose`'s, which is
 * `@smthrs/plan/Effects`: a decorator that narrows a wrapped flow's authority
 * here and a `Graph.build` that refuses a widening composition read the same
 * declaration through the same rule.
