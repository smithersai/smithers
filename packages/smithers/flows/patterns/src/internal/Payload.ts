 * The payload shape most patterns take.

 * here have always taken one opaque input: a goal, a topic, a target, a
 * question. Declaring that struct once means nine patterns share one
 * declaration instead of restating it, and a caller that reads one pattern's
 * payload has read them all.
 *
 * A pattern whose input really has fields, such as `MapReduce`'s `{ shards }`,
 * declares its own.
