/**
 * The one type a pattern names when it takes something to call.
 *
 * Every pattern in this package composes members: the flows and actions a
 * caller hands it. `@smthrs/flow` has two kinds of declaration, a `Flow` and an
 * `Action.Declared`, and both record a call the same way, through their own
 * `.call(payload)`. This module names that shared shape once so no pattern
 * restates it, and carries the one helper that records a call.
 *
 * A member is described structurally rather than as a union of the two
 * declaration types, so a caller may also hand a pattern its own object with a
 * `.call`, which is what the package's own tests do.
