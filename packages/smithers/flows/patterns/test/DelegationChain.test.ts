/**
 * `DelegationChain` on `@smthrs/flow`'s `Graph.build`.
 *
 * Every assertion is the one it was: how many calls a chain declares, what
 * each declared call is handed, which retry decorator the tier ladder carries,
 * and every refusal. Three readings moved: a call's declared payload is
 * `node.payload` rather than the first `Literal` of `keyMaterial.inputs`, a
 * `Succeed` node's value is its payload too, and a member call is found by the
 * flow tag it names rather than by a capability planted on it.
 *
 * What is NEW is the arm pair at the end: a leaf review is a `Node.branch`,
 * so the plan carries the settled arm and the next tier before anything runs.
