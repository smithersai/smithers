title: "API reference"
description: "The public API of @smthrs/patterns: the two halves every pattern exports, what it copies and compares, the three error types, and each module the other pages do not cover."
---

This page is the API reference for the higher-order flow patterns: decorators
that wrap one flow, and containers that compose several. The package composes
[`@smthrs/core`](/api/core) alone and imports no Node built-ins. Nothing in it
reaches the engine, the journal, or a host capability.

The loop, team, and delegation patterns have their own pages:
[Loops](./loops.md), [Teams](./teams.md), and [Delegation](./delegation.md).
The [module index](./modules.md) lists every module and where it is documented.

## The two halves of a pattern

Every container exports a pair.

| Half                  | What it is                                                                                                                                                    | What it must not do                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make(options)`       | A `Flow` whose body is the **conservative topology**: every rung, round, member, and compensation that the pattern could reach, declared before anything runs | Branch on a value. Core plans continuations against symbolic values, so a plan-time `if` on a result is always the same arm |
| `run(input, options)` | The `Effect` that performs the value-dependent branch at runtime, short-circuiting the parts the topology reserved                                            | Change the shape the declaration promised                                                                                   |

A planner reads `make`. A handler runs `run`. The paired surfaces use the same
behavioral option names with call-shape differences: `Kanban` passes `items` as
the first argument to `run` and reserves `until` and `maxIterations` for
runtime branching; `MergeQueue` passes `members` as the first argument to
`make`. `Trellis` is the remaining exception: `run` additionally accepts
`continue` and `concurrency`.

`Intervene` uses the same stage payloads in `make` and `run`:

| Stage     | Payload                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read`    | `{ phase: "read", input }`                              |
| `propose` | `{ phase: "propose", input, context }`                  |
| `apply`   | `{ phase: "apply", input, proposal }`                   |
| `report`  | `{ phase: "report", input, proposal, applied, dryRun }` |

A dry run omits `apply` and reports `applied: undefined`. The optional approval
callback retains its separate contract described in [Teams](./teams.md#intervene).

`Kanban` columns receive `{ item, column, previous }`. Successful predecessors
are the card values, unwrapped from the quarantine protocol. A declared later
column still receives a `Quarantined` marker after a failure; `run` skips that
card instead. Both completion callbacks receive `{ items, board }`, where
`board` contains `board`, `completed`, `failed`, and `iterations`. The declared
pass reports `iterations: 1`, retains each successful column value, and records
each card's first failure. Runtime iterations report the final pass.

Declaration-time misuse raises `PatternError` from `make`: an empty ladder, a
fractional concurrency, a compensation that is not a flow. The same condition
inside `run` becomes a typed failure rather than a throw.

## Identity and ownership

Every pattern that names things by string compares those strings the way
JavaScript does, and every pattern copies what it interprets out of the
options it is handed. This section is the contract for both.

### String identity

Item ids, member names, column names, check ids, task ids, step ids, tier
names, panelist names, and worker types are compared by exact string
equality, through `Set`, `Map`, and record keys. The comparison is
case-sensitive, trims nothing, and applies no Unicode normalization: `"é"`
as one code point and as `e` followed by a combining acute accent are two
different ids, and so are `"a"` and `"a "`. Normalize before you declare. A
record of members is read by its own enumerable string keys in the order
JavaScript reports them, which places an integer-like key such as `"10"`
ahead of the rest.

### Snapshot timing

`make` snapshots its options when it is called, before the `Flow` is
returned. The deferred body that core runs when the graph builds reads that
snapshot and never the caller's option object again. `run` snapshots its
options when it is called, before the `Effect` is returned, so an edit
between the call and the execution does not reach the effect. The decorator
factories `WithRetry.make`, `WithCache.make`, and `WithApproval.make`
snapshot when `make` is called, not when the decorator is applied, and
`WithRetry.retryEffect` snapshots when it is called. `Pattern.slot` returns a
frozen copy of its declaration, which is what `Pattern.bind` reads.

### What is copied

Copies are shallow and field by field. A pattern copies every array it
interprets and the interpreted fields of every record in it: an id, a name, a
priority, a risk, a flow, a callback. Nested bounds are copied the same way:
`WithRetry` `backoff`, `Trellis` `envelope`, `DelegationChain` `budget`. A
record of flows or callbacks (`Panel` `panelists`, `CheckSuite` `checks`,
`Supervisor` `workers`, `DelegationChain` `execute`, and the members handed
to `Bounded` and `Quarantine`) is copied as its own entries, so a
prototype-shaped name such as `"constructor"` stays a data property.
`Trellis.execute` copies the plan it is handed, and `Supervisor.run` copies
the tasks of the plan its `plan` callback returns when it validates them.

The package never freezes a caller's object and never copies below the fields
it interprets. Flows, callbacks, and schemas are references. A value the
package carries without reading stays the caller's: the flow input, the
`baseline` of `DriftDetector`, the values inside `Loop` `captures`, the
`Item` record `Kanban` hands a column, and every value a callback returns.
`Kanban` reads an item's `id` once at the call, keys the board by it, and
hands the column the caller's own record. `DriftDetector.run` reads
`baseline` once at the call and hands every callback that same reference.

Three results are frozen because they are protocol values rather than caller
data: the slot `Pattern.slot` returns, the `Succeeded` and `Quarantined`
envelopes `Quarantine` produces, and the turns in a `Debate.run` transcript.
Every other result is a fresh plain object the caller may keep or edit.

## Errors

The package raises three tagged errors. `PatternError` is the shared one:
every module except `Trellis` and `DelegationChain` reports its refusals and
exhaustions through it. Those two own their own errors because every
rejection they report carries a plan path, and a path is what an author has
to read to repair a plan. All three carry a `code` from a stable literal
schema, a `message`, and an optional `cause`, and none of them carries the
input that produced the failure.

### `PatternError`

`PatternError` carries a `code` from `PatternErrorCode`, a message, and an
optional `cause` with the reported error or errors.

| Code                  | Raised when                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `missing_slot`        | A required `Pattern.slot` was neither bound nor defaulted                                                           |
| `invalid_decorator`   | A decorator broke a schema or authority contract, or an option was out of range                                     |
| `invalid_input`       | A flow input, a `Supervisor` plan, an `Optimizer` or `Sidecar` score, or a `Quarantine.settle` entry was malformed  |
| `envelope_conflict`   | A supplied flow declares authority its template excludes                                                            |
| `recursion_bound`     | `Recursion.recurse` hit its declared depth                                                                          |
| `exhausted`           | A runtime pattern reached its declared iteration or round limit, or `MapReduce` was configured to fail on no shards |
| `finalizer_failed`    | A `TryCatchFinally` finalizer failed after the protected body settled                                               |
| `compensation_failed` | One or more `Saga` compensations failed while unwinding                                                             |
| `quarantined`         | `Quarantine.settle` was called on a result holding quarantined members                                              |

### `TrellisError`

`TrellisError` carries a `code` from `TrellisErrorCode`, the plan `path` the
fault was found at (`root`, or a path such as `root.parallel[1].sequence[0]`),
a message, and an optional `cause`. `Trellis.validate` returns every refusal
it finds as an array and attaches no cause. `Trellis.make` throws one, and
`Trellis.execute` and `Trellis.run` fail with one for admission errors.
A plan validation failure from `Trellis.run` preserves the first refusal's code,
path, and message and carries `{ rounds, remaining, refusals }` as its cause.
`refusals` contains every validation reason. A later round that exceeds the
remaining fuel carries `{ rounds, remaining }`.

Typed leaf failures in `Trellis.run` become `leaf_failed` at the leaf's path,
with `{ rounds, remaining, error }` as the cause. `error` is the original leaf
failure. `rounds` contains completed rounds only; `remaining` is the fuel left
after those rounds, before charging the failed round. `Trellis.execute`
continues to propagate typed leaf failures unchanged.

`DelegationChain.run` reports the first refusal with all `refusals` in the
same cause when the derisked plan does not fit its envelope. Its `rounds` is
empty and `remaining` is the envelope fuel because execution has not started.

| Code               | Path          | Raised when                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_envelope` | `root`        | A `fuel`, `depth`, or `fanout` bound, or a `concurrency`, is not a positive safe integer                                                                                         |
| `invalid_plan`     | the node      | A node is not exactly one of `agent`, `sequence`, or `parallel`, an agent has no non-empty string `goal` or carries a non-string `seat`, or a container is not a non-empty array |
| `depth_exceeded`   | the node      | A node nests deeper than the envelope `depth`                                                                                                                                    |
| `fanout_exceeded`  | the container | A container holds more members than the envelope `fanout`                                                                                                                        |
| `fuel_exhausted`   | `root`        | A plan needs more leaf calls than the envelope `fuel`, or than the fuel left after earlier rounds                                                                                |
| `leaf_failed`      | the leaf      | A leaf effect fails during `Trellis.run`                                                                                                                                         |

### `DelegationError`

`DelegationError` carries a `code` from `DelegationErrorCode`, a `path`
(`root` for the chain itself, or the leaf's plan path), a message, and an
optional `cause`. `DelegationChain.make` throws one and `DelegationChain.run`
fails with one. See
[Delegation patterns](./delegation.md#delegationchain) for how the
chain climbs its tier ladder and what a repair looks like.

| Code             | Path     | Cause                                                                                                     | Raised when                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_bounds` | `root`   | none                                                                                                      | `maxDepth`, `maxDeriskRounds`, or `maxAttempts` is not a positive safe integer, `concurrency` is set and is not one, or `tierOrder` is empty |
| `missing_tier`   | `root`   | none                                                                                                      | `tierOrder` names a tier that `execute` has no flow or callback for                                                                          |
| `derisk_failed`  | `root`   | none                                                                                                      | A `PatternError` was raised inside the derisk loop; the message is that error's                                                              |
| `leaf_failed`    | the leaf | The per-tier attempts, `{ tier, error }` or `{ tier, rejected }`, or the `PatternError` the ladder raised | No tier settled the leaf within `maxAttempts` attempts each                                                                                  |

## `Pattern`

`Pattern.slot({ input, output, default? })` declares a flow-valued hole: two
schemas, and optionally a default flow to fill it. The default is checked
against the schemas at the call, and the slot comes back as a frozen copy.
`Pattern.bind(slot, supplied?)` resolves the slot to the supplied flow or the
default, applies the same check, and raises `missing_slot` when there is
neither and `invalid_decorator` when the schemas do not fit.

`Pattern.decorate(flow, decorator)` applies a decorator and re-declares the
result under the wrapped flow's schemas and its authority ceiling: capabilities
are intersected with the wrapped flow's, and a decorator result that widens the
wrapped flow's effect envelope is refused with `envelope_conflict`. The
decorator call becomes part of declaration identity, so a wrapped flow and a
bare one are different steps. `Pattern.decorateAll(flow, decorators)` applies a
list left to right, which puts the last decorator outermost.
`Pattern.clipped(template, supplied)` reports what a template excludes from a
supplied flow: the capabilities, reads, writes, mode, and tier that the
re-declaration removes.

The three `With*` modules are this combinator with a policy attached.

## `WithRetry`

`WithRetry.withRetry(flow, { attempts, backoff?, nonRetryable? })` wraps a flow
in a retry declaration, and `WithRetry.make(options)` is the same thing as a
decorator you can pass to `Pattern.decorateAll`. The wrapper preserves the
wrapped flow's graph and records the policy as declaration identity, so two
plans that differ only in an attempt budget are different declarations.
`WithRetry.retryEffect(effect, options)` performs the retry at the Effect
boundary, because a retry has no truthful form as a success-only `Node.andThen`
chain.

`attempts` is the total attempt count and must be a positive safe integer.
`backoff` is `{ initialMs, factor, maxMs }`, and the delay before attempt
`n + 1` is `min(initialMs * factor^(n - 1), maxMs)`. There is no jitter,
because a plan built twice has to describe the same waits. `nonRetryable` lists
error `_tag` values that end the sequence the first time one appears, whatever
the budget says. Fiber interruption is never retried, so a cancelled run stays
cancelled. The option names mirror `@smthrs/flow` `RetryPolicy`, so a pattern
policy and an engine policy translate one to one. See
[Retries](/docs/concepts/retries/).

## `WithApproval`

`WithApproval.withApproval(flow, { reason, approval })` runs an approval flow
ahead of the flow it gates, calling it with `{ input, reason, scope }`, where
`scope` is the string `"run"`. The approval flow must declare its output as
`WithApproval.Approved`, the literal `"approved"`. A denial therefore cannot
decode, and it fails on the typed schema-error channel before the gated flow
starts, rather than arriving as a boolean the gated flow is trusted to honor.
An empty `reason` is refused with `invalid_decorator`. `WithApproval.make`
is the decorator form.

## `WithCache`

`WithCache.withCache(flow, { ttlMs?, scope?, version? })` wraps a flow with a
cache declaration. `WithCache.make(options)` is the decorator form, usable with
`Pattern.decorate` and `Pattern.decorateAll`.

The input must explicitly declare effects with `mode: "hermetic"` and a
`"sealed"` or omitted tier. A pure body without an effects declaration is
rejected. Every option is optional:

| Field     | Contract                                                                                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ttlMs`   | Positive safe integer in milliseconds, measured from when the result was recorded. Omit for no age bound. |
| `scope`   | `"run"`, `"flow"`, or `"shared"`. Omit to retain the composition's reach.                                 |
| `version` | Nonblank string naming the body revision. Omit for no extra revision in the key.                          |

Invalid effects, TTL, or version throw `PatternError` with code
`invalid_decorator` synchronously when the decorator is applied.
`make` snapshots its options at construction and validates them on application.

All declared fields enter the wrapper's name and captured key material.
`version` changes declaration identity only. `ttlMs` and `scope` also travel
in `WithCache.CachePolicyAnnotation`, under `@smthrs/flow/Action/CachePolicy`.
`WithCache.policyOf(annotations)` reads that bag. Decorator composition
preserves annotations, with an outer decorator's values overriding inner ones.

The flow-level bag requires a host to lower it. The [`@smthrs/registry`](/api/registry)
bridge lowers a module's default-exported core flow policy onto a dispatched
action. An ordinary nested core flow call does not propagate that bag onto its
call node. The durable engine reads the action-level policy set by
`CacheEnvironment.withCache(action, policy)` from [`@smthrs/flow`](/api/flow).
See [`@smthrs/step-cache`](/api/step-cache) for enforcement. `WithCache` itself
allocates no cache and performs no expiry checks.

```ts
import { Effects, Flow, Node } from "@smthrs/core"
import { WithCache } from "@smthrs/patterns"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const echo = Flow.make({
  name: "echo",
  input: Schema.String,
  output: Schema.String,
  effects: Effects.make({
    reads: [],
    writes: [],
    mode: "hermetic",
    onConflict: "serialize"
  }),
  body: (input) => Node.succeed(input)
})

// The registry bridge lowers this default export's policy onto an action.
export default WithCache.withCache(echo, { ttlMs: 60_000, version: "v1" })
```

## `Bounded`

`Bounded.all(members, { concurrency, priority? })` splits a named record into
batches of `concurrency` and sequences the batches, so the plan shows exactly
how many calls can be in flight. `Bounded.run(members, { concurrency,
priority?, priorities? })` is the Effect form.

Members are ordered by priority, highest first, and declaration order breaks a
tie so a plan built twice from one record is identical. A member that carries
its own `Node.priority` keeps it; every other member inherits the container's.
Priority is a scheduling hint and never enters key material, so raising it does
not invalidate a cached step.

`Bounded.run` follows `Effect.forEach`: the first failure interrupts the
members still in flight.

## `Quarantine`

`Quarantine.all(members, { policy: "quarantine" })` settles every member in an
explicit envelope: `{ _tag: "Succeeded", member, value }` or
`{ _tag: "Quarantined", member, error }`. Nesting successful values makes the
protocol unambiguous even when a user value has either complete wire shape.
`policy: "halt"` is a plain join that preserves raw successful values and does
interrupt siblings. `Quarantine.run` is the Effect form, and
`Quarantine.settle` unwraps successes or returns a `quarantined` failure.
`isSucceeded` and `isQuarantined` narrow joined entries. Typed failures are
isolated; defects and interruptions still propagate.

## `MapReduce`

`MapReduce.make({ map, reduce, concurrency, onEmpty })` declares one map call
per shard, batched into `Node.all` groups of `concurrency` with the batches
sequenced, then one reduce call. The flow input is `{ shards }`, and the array
has to be a literal value available while the graph builds, because a
declaration cannot count shards it does not hold. Members are keyed by ordinal
(`shard-0`, `shard-1`), which makes the reduce input independent of the order
the workers finish in.

`MapReduce.run(input, options)` maps with `Effect.forEach` at `concurrency` and
reduces in shard order. `map` receives `{ shard, index, input }` and `reduce`
receives `{ input, mapped }`.

`onEmpty` decides what an empty shard list means: `"reduce"` calls the reducer
with an empty array, `"succeed"` returns an empty array without calling it, and
`"fail"` reports `exhausted`. `concurrency` must be a positive safe integer.

## `Recursion`

`Recursion.recurse({ child, fuel, depth, fanout, parent? })` expands a tree of
work into a declared graph. A plain value is a leaf; a `{ input, children }`
branch expands recursively. Fuel is shared by the whole tree, depth is
decremented per level, and every child list is checked against fan-out before
any child is admitted. Each child call receives `{ input, envelope }`, where
the envelope carries the fuel left, the depth left, and the fan-out bound, so a
child can attenuate what it was given.

The tree has to be a value you already hold, because the expansion happens
while the graph is built. For a tree a model writes while the run is in flight,
use [`Trellis`](./delegation.md#trellis), which validates a plan before
compiling it.

A nested call may narrow its parent envelope and may not widen it, and `parent`
is the envelope it is checked against. Every bound must be a positive safe
integer. Exhausting fuel, nesting past `depth`, or exceeding `fanout` raises
`recursion_bound`.

## `Debate`

`Debate.make({ proponent, opponent, judge, rounds })` declares `rounds`
alternations of proponent then opponent, then one judge call over the whole
transcript. `rounds` is expanded while the flow is declared, so the call count
is a fact about the declaration rather than about a run.

`Debate.run(input, options)` supplies the accumulated transcript instead:
`proponent` receives `{ input, transcript, round }`, `opponent` receives that
plus `proponent`, and `judge` receives `{ input, transcript }`. The judge's
value is the result. Each turn is frozen as it is appended and each callback
gets a frozen snapshot of the transcript, while the payloads inside a turn stay
the caller's own references. `rounds` must be a positive safe integer.

## `Panel`

`Panel.make({ panelists, moderator, roles?, concurrency? })` declares one call
per panelist, then the moderator over `{ input, opinions }`. A role named in
`roles` is passed to that panelist as `{ input, role }` and enters its key
material, so changing a role changes the declaration. `Panel.run` keys opinions
by panelist name whatever order they complete in.

## `ReviewLoop`

`ReviewLoop.make({ produce, review, revise, maxRounds })` declares one produce
call, then up to `maxRounds` reviews with a revise call between each pair:
`maxRounds: 3` declares six calls. `ReviewLoop.run(input, options)` produces
once, then reviews and revises until a review is accepted, and stops at that
round.

`review` receives `(output, round)` and `revise` receives
`{ output, review, round }`. `ReviewLoop.accepted` is the acceptance reader:
`true`, `"approved"`, `{ approved: true }`, or `{ accepted: true }`. Both
outcomes are tagged and nest the produced value: an approved round returns
`{ _tag: "Approved", output }` and a run that spends every round returns
`{ _tag: "Exhausted", output, review }` rather than failing, so the caller
branches on `_tag` and decides what an unapproved result is worth. The value
the loop produced never forges the other arm, whatever shape it has.
`maxRounds` must be a positive safe integer.

Use `ReviewLoop` when one artifact is revised in place. When every issue needs
its own fix, use [`ScanFixVerify`](./loops.md#scanfixverify).

## `Escalation`

`Escalation.make({ rungs, accept?, fallback? })` declares a ladder of
alternative strategies. A rung is a flow, or `{ flow, escalateIf }` when that
rung decides for itself. `accept` decides every rung that declares no
`escalateIf`; `fallback` is the last rung and runs only after all of them
escalated, which is where a human approval flow belongs.

`Escalation.run(input, options)` returns `{ level, result, exhausted: false }`
naming the rung that settled, counting from zero. A fallback result carries the
rung count. If every rung escalates and no fallback is declared, the last
result comes back as `{ level, result, accepted: false, exhausted: true }`.
`exhausted` is present on both arms, so a caller reads it without a property
check.

`defaultEscalate` is the predicate used by `Escalation.run` when a rung has
neither an `escalateIf` nor a shared `accept`. `Escalation.make` instead
reserves every such rung because a declaration cannot branch on a value it
does not have. The runtime predicate escalates on a missing result and on the
conventional failure markers: a set `error`, `failed: true`, or `ok: false`.

Rungs are alternative strategies, not model-seat fallback. Provider and seat
fallback belong to model routing, before a flow is selected.

## `TryCatchFinally`

`TryCatchFinally.make({ try, catch?, catchErrors?, finally? })` declares the
protected call, the recovery arm `catchErrors` selects, and a finalizer call on
the settled arm and on the arm no handler claimed. The unhandled arm ends in
`Node.fail`, so the plan states that the finalizer cleans up and hands the
failure back rather than absorbing it. A finalizer that fails on that arm is
caught there, so the body failure the arm re-raises is still the one the
boundary reports; the failed finalizer call remains a step of its own. Both
arms are wrapped in `Node.capture`, so the boundary keys the same way on every
build.

`TryCatchFinally.run(input, options)` takes `catchErrors` as a predicate,
because the runtime form already holds the decoded typed error. The finalizer
runs after success, after recovery, after an unclaimed failure, and after
interruption. A finalizer that fails on its own becomes `finalizer_failed`; a
body failure outranks it, so cleanup trouble never hides the reason the body
failed. When both fail, the `finalizer_failed` error rides behind the body
failure on the same cause rather than being dropped, so a lock left held is
still on the record.

## `Saga`

`Saga.make({ steps, onFailure })` declares the forward chain and its
compensation arms. Each step's continuation is wrapped in a `Node.catch` whose
arm calls that step's compensation and re-raises, so a failure deeper in the
chain unwinds one step at a time, most recent first, and the plan lists the
compensation calls in reverse order. `onFailure` defaults to `compensate` in
both halves. `make` refuses a step whose action or compensation is not a flow.
Both compensation policies continue unwinding after an undo fails and report
`PatternError { code: "compensation_failed" }`. Its cause holds the original
`failure` and the failed undos in `residue`, sorted by step id. A chain that
runs to the end returns `{ _tag: "Completed", values }`, where `values` holds
each step's value keyed by step id. A clean unwind returns
`{ _tag: "Compensated", failure }` under `compensate` and re-raises the
original failure under `compensate-and-fail`. Step values are nested under
`values`, so a step id can never forge the compensated arm.

`Saga.run(input, { steps, onFailure })` registers one scope finalizer per
completed step, so the unwind is LIFO and runs on interruption as well as on
failure. A compensation that dies or whose callback throws before returning an
effect is recorded as a failed compensation rather
than raised as a defect, so the residue still names it and the finalizers
behind it still run. See
[Undo work with compensation](/docs/guides/compensation/).

## A worked release

[Failure control](/docs/examples/30-failure-control/) runs one release through
five of these patterns: bounded checks, a quarantined flake, an escalating
fixer, a saga that unwinds a half-finished deploy, and a lock the finalizer
always releases. Its first assertion reads the declaration alone, before
anything runs, to show the compensations in reverse order.

## Declaration size

Every `make` expands its declared bounds eagerly into graph nodes. The options
that expand or multiply topology are `Loop.maxIterations`,
`ReviewLoop.maxRounds`, `Debate.rounds`, `Recursion` envelope depth across
fanout, `ScanFixVerify.maxRetries` times `maxIssues` in concurrency-sized
batches, `Trellis` envelope fuel, and `DelegationChain.maxDepth` together with
`maxDeriskRounds`. These bounds are sized for tens to low hundreds of declared
calls. A very large bound builds a very large graph before anything runs. For
an unbounded loop, use the `run` half under an external scheduler instead of
unrolling it in `make`.

A bound that unrolls into a sequenced chain is capped a second way. Core
refuses a plan nested past `Graph.maximumGraphDepth`, which is 512 levels, and
each chained call costs one level, so a chain reaches 511 declared calls, or
255 when a unit declares two of them. `Loop.make` refuses a `maxIterations`
past that limit at the declaration, with an `invalid_decorator` `PatternError`
naming the option and the limit. Every other pattern reaches the ceiling as a
`plan_too_deep` `GraphBuildError` from `Graph.build`, which carries no
message. The limit counts the chain alone, so deeper member flows or an
enclosing unrolled pattern lower it.

## Entry points

The root exports each module as a namespace, and every module is also
importable as `@smthrs/patterns/<Module>`. The `internal/*` and nested
`*/index` subpaths are private. The [module index](./modules.md) lists all 28
modules with their specifiers.

`@smthrs/core` supplies `Flow`, `Node`, and `Graph`. See
[Flows, actions, and plans](/docs/concepts/flows-actions-plans/) for what a built
graph means, and [`@smthrs/plan`](/api/plan) for the persisted form a graph
compiles into.
