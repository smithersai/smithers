## Install the package

```bash
pnpm add @smthrs/keys@next @effect/platform-node@4.0.0-rc.115 effect@4.0.0-rc.115
```

`@effect/platform-node` provides `NodeCrypto` for the example below and is
optional if you supply your own `Crypto` implementation.

`npm install` and `bun add` take the same arguments. The current version is
`1.0.0-rc.0`. Release candidates publish on the `next` dist-tag, which is what
`@next` selects; once 1.0 is final the plain package name gets it.

[`effect`](https://effect.website) is a peer dependency at that exact version,
because the schemas this package exports have to be the ones your own code
composes with. Two more dependencies install with the package and are the only
ones: [`@smthrs/canonical`](/api/canonical) for the serialization and
[`@smthrs/crypto`](/api/crypto) for the digest.

The package requires Node.js 22.19.0 or later and ships as ESM and CommonJS
with TypeScript declarations.

## Provide a Crypto service

`deriveKey` and `DerivedKey` return an Effect that requires
`Crypto.Crypto` from `effect/Crypto`. The package imports no `node:` builtin
and ships no implementation of its own, which is what lets the same source
bundle for a browser. You choose where the hashing happens.

On Node.js or Bun, use the platform layer:

```ts
import * as NodeCrypto from "@effect/platform-node/NodeCrypto"
import { deriveKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const program = deriveKey({ domain: "docs/install", version: 1 }).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeCrypto.layer)
)
```

Where you want no platform dependency at all, `@smthrs/crypto` ships a
synchronous SHA-256-only service. It refuses randomness and every other digest
algorithm, so use it for identity construction and supply a real platform layer
for anything else:

```ts
import { syncCrypto } from "@smthrs/crypto"
import { deriveKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Crypto from "effect/Crypto"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

const key = Effect.runSync(
  deriveKey({ domain: "docs/install", version: 1 }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(Layer.succeed(Crypto.Crypto)(syncCrypto))
  )
)
```

In a browser, compose `BrowserCrypto` from `@effect/platform-browser`, or the
synchronous service above. [`@smthrs/platform-browser`](/api/platform-browser)
deliberately omits `Crypto`, so it does not pick for you.

`StoredKey`, `KeyV1`, and `digest` require no `Crypto` service. A boundary that
only validates keys installs nothing.

## Import forms

The root entry point re-exports every module:

```ts
import { DerivedKey, deriveKey, digest, KeyDerivationError, KeyV1, StoredKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
```

Every name is also importable from the `Key` subpath:

```ts
import * as Key from "@smthrs/keys/Key"
```

Two subpath forms are blocked in the export map and are not public:
`@smthrs/keys/internal/*` and `@smthrs/keys/*/index`.
`@smthrs/keys/package.json` is exported.

## Next step

Derive a key, store it, and read it back in the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md).
