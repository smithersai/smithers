title: "API reference"
description: "Every export of @smthrs/keys: deriveKey, DerivedKey, StoredKey, KeyV1, digest, KeyDerivationError, and KeyDerivationErrorCode, with signatures, requirements, and failures."
---

Every name below is available from the root entry point and from
`@smthrs/keys/Key`. Each is defined in the source file that carries its name.

```ts
import { DerivedKey, deriveKey, digest, KeyDerivationError, KeyV1, StoredKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
```

## Derivation

Both entry points perform the same three steps: canonicalize with
[`@smthrs/canonical`](/api/canonical), hash the canonical UTF-8 document with
SHA-256 through the injected Effect `Crypto` service that
[`@smthrs/crypto`](/api/crypto) wraps, and prefix the lowercase digest with
`key1_`. Neither validates an existing key. See
[Key derivation](./concepts/key-derivation.md).

### deriveKey

```ts
const deriveKey: (input: unknown) => Effect.Effect<KeyV1, KeyDerivationError, Crypto.Crypto>
```

Derives the current key format from structured input.

- `input`: any value with a canonical form. Values without one fail; see
  [Key material](./concepts/key-material.md).
- Returns a branded `KeyV1`, always 69 characters.
- Requires `Crypto.Crypto` from `effect/Crypto`. A missing service is an
  unsatisfied Effect requirement and therefore a configuration defect, not a
  `KeyDerivationError`.
- Fails with `KeyDerivationError`.

```ts
import * as NodeCrypto from "@effect/platform-node/NodeCrypto"
import { deriveKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const key = await Effect.runPromise(
  deriveKey({ domain: "example/compile", version: 1, source: "main.ts" }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(NodeCrypto.layer)
  )
)
// key1_74a286a394e4b0619c05801dd4e7315deeb83b8203cd3c3ee7cd6033ec55c683
```

### DerivedKey

```ts
const DerivedKey: Schema.Codec<KeyV1, unknown, Crypto.Crypto, never>
```

The same derivation as a schema transformation, for composing inside a decode.
Decoding requires the `Crypto` service; encoding requires none.

- Decoding derives a fresh key from whatever it is given. Decoding the text
  `key1_...` hashes that text into a different key; it does not parse it. Use
  `StoredKey` for that.
- Encoding is forbidden and reports
  `A key cannot be converted back into its input`.
- Operational failures become `SchemaError` issues whose message is
  `[<code>] <message>`. The typed `KeyDerivationError` is retained on the
  failing issue's annotations as `cause`, next to the stable `code`.
- The schema pins `parseOptions: { reportInput: false }`, so its own
  `InvalidValue` and `Encoding` issues omit input even when the caller requests
  input reporting. Enclosing schemas such as `Struct` and `Array` decoded with
  `{ reportInput: true }` retain the entire enclosing input on their own
  `Composite` issue, including key material. Keep input reporting off at the
  outer decoding boundary, or strip issue inputs before retaining diagnostics.
  See the [boundary annotation example](./guides/derive-a-key-inside-a-schema.md#input-reporting-stops-at-the-derivedkey-boundary).
- Annotated with the identifier `@smthrs/keys/Key`.

```ts
import { DerivedKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const program = Schema.decodeUnknownEffect(DerivedKey)({ domain: "example/compile", version: 1 })
```

See [Derive a key inside a schema](./guides/derive-a-key-inside-a-schema.md).

## Validation

Validation returns the input text unchanged, performs no hashing, and requires
no `Crypto` service.

### StoredKey

```ts
const StoredKey: typeof KeyV1
type StoredKey = typeof StoredKey.Type
```

Every stored-key representation this release understands. It is intentionally
equal to `KeyV1` today and is a separate export because its meaning is
different: `KeyV1` names one format, `StoredKey` names what the running release
can validate. Use `StoredKey` at persistence, RPC, journal, and
external-input boundaries.

A future format joins this schema only when its complete representation and
derivation are supported. Unknown `key<n>_` prefixes are rejected rather than
guessed.

```ts
import { StoredKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const key = Schema.decodeUnknownSync(StoredKey)(persistedText)
```

### KeyV1

```ts
const KeyV1: Schema.Codec<KeyV1, string>
type KeyV1 = typeof KeyV1.Type
```

The exact persisted representation produced by the version-one derivation:
`key1_` followed by 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters, 69 characters in
total. Branded as `@smthrs/keys/Key`, so the type is only obtainable by
decoding.

Rejected input includes `key2_`, `key0_`, `key01_`, an uppercase digest, a
payload that is not exactly 64 hexadecimal characters, the empty string, and
any non-string. The rejection message is
`Expected key1_ followed by a 64-character lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 digest`.

Unlike `DerivedKey`, this schema does not suppress input reporting: a caller
that decodes with `{ reportInput: true }` gets the rejected text back in the
message.

### digest

```ts
const digest: (key: StoredKey) => Digest
```

Returns the validated SHA-256 payload of a stored key: the 64 lowercase
hexadecimal characters after the prefix. `Digest` is the branded digest type
from [`@smthrs/crypto`](/api/crypto).

The function takes an already-validated `StoredKey` and does not re-check it.
It exists so that prefix knowledge stays in this package instead of spreading
into `slice` calls and delimiter searches at every call site.

```ts
import { digest, StoredKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const payload = digest(Schema.decodeUnknownSync(StoredKey)(persistedText))
// 74a286a394e4b0619c05801dd4e7315deeb83b8203cd3c3ee7cd6033ec55c683
```

## Errors

### KeyDerivationError

```ts
class KeyDerivationError extends Schema.TaggedError<KeyDerivationError>()(
  "@smthrs/keys/KeyDerivationError",
  { code: KeyDerivationErrorCode, message: Schema.String, cause: Schema.Unknown }
) {}
```

The only failure `deriveKey` reports.

- `code`: stable, for control flow.
- `message`: one of two fixed sentences,
  `Key input could not be canonicalized` or
  `Canonical key material could not be hashed`. It never contains the input.
- `cause`: the original schema or crypto failure, retained for diagnostics. A
  canonicalization cause names the JSON path of the offending value, which
  includes object property names. See
  [Handle a derivation failure](./guides/handle-a-derivation-failure.md).

### KeyDerivationErrorCode

```ts
const KeyDerivationErrorCode: Schema.Literals<["canonicalization_failed", "digest_failed"]>
type KeyDerivationErrorCode = typeof KeyDerivationErrorCode.Type
```

| Code                      | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `canonicalization_failed` | The input has no accepted canonical form.                            |
| `digest_failed`           | The injected SHA-256 operation failed or returned an invalid digest. |

A missing `Crypto.Crypto` service is deliberately not a member. It remains an
unsatisfied Effect requirement, which is a configuration defect rather than a
provided host failing an operation.

## Ownership

Only this package owns the `key<n>_` wire form; treat a key as opaque
everywhere else. Canonicalization rules belong to
[`@smthrs/canonical`](/api/canonical), and SHA-256 input and host rules belong
to [`@smthrs/crypto`](/api/crypto). Domain material belongs to each caller: see
[Separate identity namespaces](./guides/separate-identity-namespaces.md).

A future version arrives as an additional member of `StoredKey`, never as a
loosened `KeyV1`, so keys you have already stored keep validating. See
[the wire format](./concepts/wire-format.md).
