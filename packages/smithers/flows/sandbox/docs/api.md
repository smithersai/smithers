---

`@smthrs/sandbox` adapts a provider a caller hands it onto Effect's host
services. The smallest composition adapts a spawn-only provider onto
`ChildProcessSpawner`:

```ts
import { RemoteChildProcessSpawner } from "@smthrs/sandbox"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as ChildProcess from "effect/unstable/process/ChildProcess"
import { ChildProcessSpawner } from "effect/unstable/process/ChildProcessSpawner"

const provider = RemoteChildProcessSpawner.TestRemote.make({
  scripts: { "echo hi": { stdout: "hi" } }
})

const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const spawner = yield* ChildProcessSpawner
  return yield* spawner.string(ChildProcess.make("echo", ["hi"]))
}).pipe(Effect.provide(RemoteChildProcessSpawner.layer(provider)))
```

The package depends on `@smthrs/kernel`, for `CommandLine` rendering and quoting alone, and on no other Smithers package: a sandbox is one way to satisfy Effect's `ChildProcessSpawner`, not a new host interface a caller has to learn. It bundles for the browser because host access arrives through a provider or through injected host services.

## Entry points

Every namespace is also its own subpath, and `./internal/*` is null mapped.

## RemoteChildProcessSpawner

Provider acquisition is tied to the layer scope: interrupting an execution or a stream consumer closes that scope and therefore runs the finalizer installed by `Provider.open`. No `AbortSignal` crosses this seam.

A provider may add SDK details to `ProviderError.cause`, but it cannot create new host-visible failure kinds. The code set is closed, and one shared table normalizes each code onto the `PlatformError` reason that already means it: `timeout` becomes `TimedOut`, `unavailable` and `not_found` become `NotFound`, everything else becomes `Unknown`, under the `ChildProcess` module the sibling spawners name. `not_found` and `unavailable` stay apart in the provider vocabulary, where "absent" and "broken" are different facts; they say the same thing to a caller of a spawner, which is to try somewhere else, and a caller that needs the distinction reads the `ProviderError` back off `PlatformError.cause`. `Sandbox.fileSystem` is the one deliberate exception: there `unavailable` stays `Unknown`, because a filesystem's `NotFound` is load bearing (`exists` turns it into `false`) and a broken session must not read as an absent path.

`Provider.kill` and `Provider.ping` are optional, because a transport that can only post a command line has neither. A provider that implements them buys two things it cannot otherwise have: one command can be stopped without tearing down the session that runs it, and the session's liveness can be supervised. When `kill` is present the adapter maps `ChildProcessHandle.kill` onto it and signals a still-running command when its scope closes, ahead of the provider's own release finalizer; a process this side has already seen exit is left alone. When `kill` is absent the adapter refuses with a `BadArgument` `PlatformError` rather than pretending to have delivered a signal.

The command reaches the provider as the string `CommandLine.render` produces: the same string `@smthrs/kernel`'s `proc:spawn` check is written against, so a grant and the thing it authorizes cannot drift apart.

Unsupported semantics are declared rather than dropped. Each of these fails with a `BadArgument` `PlatformError` before the provider is asked to start anything:

`stdin: "pipe"`, `"ignore"`, and `"overlapped"` are accepted and all three mean the command reads no input, which is what they mean locally. A provider that declares `stdin: true` receives the command's input as one complete byte blob in `RemoteOptions.stdin`, never as a live pipe: collection is bounded at 16 MiB and the count runs as the bytes arrive, so an endless producer is refused at the bound rather than after it finishes. The handle's own `stdin` sink always fails, because there is no interactive channel either way. Output `pipe`, `ignore`, and `inherit` options and output sinks are applied by the adapter.

:::caution[Two divergences the error channel cannot report]
`extendEnv` is ignored, because the remote session's ambient environment never crosses the seam and `extendEnv: false` cannot clear an environment this side never held. `isRunning` answers from what this side has observed: the adapter forks a scoped observer of the provider's exit at spawn and memoizes it, so liveness turns `false` when that observation lands, which can lag the remote process by a scheduler tick but does not depend on a caller reading `exitCode`.
:::

The code set belongs to this seam, because a remote session goes wrong in ways a local spawn has no vocabulary for. Like the health reasons below, the codes are a stable public contract: a new kind of failure gets a new code rather than repurposing an existing one.

## SandboxHealth

`SandboxHealth` answers one question about a session that is already open: is the machine still there? It is a verdict vocabulary plus a probe, not a supervisor, so nothing here runs on a cadence. `SandboxSupervision` below is what probes on an interval and acts on the answer.

`probe` never fails: a failed ping becomes `Unhealthy(reason: "ping_failed")`, and a ping that outlives the deadline (5 seconds by default) becomes `Unhealthy(reason: "unresponsive")`. That is what distinguishes "sandbox dead" from "slow command": the probe answers within the deadline either way. `Unhealthy.component` is `"sandbox"`, so an "engine alive, sandbox dead" diagnosis is explicit rather than inferred from a generic provider error.

A failed ping is logged at debug level as the provider's `code` and its `message`, and the verdict carries that same message, bounded at 512 characters with control characters collapsed to spaces. The probe never logs the `ProviderError` object or its `cause`. Bundled SDK adapters keep raw vendor exception text in `cause` and use controlled ping failure messages. Cause omission is not message redaction: a custom provider must keep credentials and other sensitive data out of `ProviderError.message`, since both Debug logging and the verdict expose it. A host that wants the raw failure taps the ping it hands in (`Effect.tapError` on `PingProvider.ping`) and applies its own redaction.

Reasons, like the host error codes, are a stable public contract: never repurpose one, add one.

## SandboxSupervision

`SandboxHealth` reports a verdict; supervision is what acts on one. It holds a single provider session, probes it on `interval`, and retires it after `tolerance` consecutive unhealthy verdicts (default 1; one healthy answer resets the count). Retiring fails every pending operation and output consumer in the session with a `NotFound` `PlatformError`, the same reason a session that refused to open produces, because both say the same thing to a retry policy. Output consumers remain guarded after process exit until their own streams finish. Retirement then closes the session scope so the provider's finalizer runs, and lets the next command open a fresh session. That failure is the point: under the plain adapter a session that dies leaves its commands waiting forever, because a dead session is silent.

Retirement fails pending consumers and closes the provider scope uninterruptibly while holding the spawn permit. It then releases the permit and forks the reporter in the supervisor's scope, so a slow reporter delays neither new commands nor the heartbeat. Reporter failures are logged at Warn, and an interruptible reporter still pending after 30 seconds is interrupted on the platform timer. A provider release failure is logged at Warn with the session key; the retirement is still reported and probing continues for later sessions.

The session opens on the first command, not while the layer builds: a host that never spawns anything must not pay for a sandbox, and a provider that is down must fail the action that needed it rather than the composition root. An open that fails leaves the cell empty and closes its own scope, so the next command opens a fresh generation instead of replaying the first failure. A provider without `ping` is never probed, so wrapping one in supervision costs nothing and changes nothing.

```ts
import { SandboxSupervision } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const spawner = SandboxSupervision.layer(provider, { interval: "10 seconds", tolerance: 2 })
```

## ProviderConformance

The contract a spawn-only provider must satisfy is stated as behavior, so your adapter can run the statement against the backend it actually talks to:

```ts
import { ProviderConformance } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const violations = yield* ProviderConformance.check(provider, {
  writes: "sh -c 'printf hello'",
  output: "hello",
  fails: "sh -c 'exit 3'",
  failureCode: 3,
  runs: "sh -c 'sleep 60'",
  shell: true
})
```

`Commands.shell` defaults to `false`. Set it to `true` when the fixture strings are shell lines; the suite then renders them verbatim instead of POSIX quoting each whole string as one program token. `SandboxConformance.posixCommands` sets it for its POSIX fixtures.

The checklist:

| Check                       | What the provider must do                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `writes-its-output`         | `writes` puts exactly `output` on stdout and exits 0                                                                                                  |
| `reports-a-nonzero-exit`    | `fails` reports `failureCode` as an exit code, not as a failure                                                                                       |
| `delivers-standard-input`   | a provider that declares `stdin: true` hands the bytes to the command, proven by running `Commands.copiesStdin` (default `cat`) and reading them back |
| `answers-a-ping`            | a declared `ping` answers while the session is open                                                                                                   |
| `signals-a-running-command` | a declared `kill` stops a live process                                                                                                                |

The stdin check exists because the declaration is what makes the adapter hand the bytes over. A suite that took `stdin: true` at its word would pass an adapter that sets the flag and then ignores `RemoteOptions.stdin`, which is exactly the silent input loss the flag was added to close.

The kill check watches the process, not the call. A `kill` that returns success and leaves the command running satisfies the type and leaks a process inside the sandbox for every cancelled action, so the check waits for `runs` to stop and reports `the command was still running after the signal` when it does not. How it stopped is not the subject: a provider that reports a signalled process as a failed `exitCode` is as conforming as one that reports a status. `Commands.stopsWithin` bounds the wait, defaulting to `ProviderConformance.defaultStopsWithin` (5 seconds). The handle is only the wrapper, though, and a shell that dies while its child lives on satisfies every observation the handle allows, so a fixture may also name `Commands.survivor`: a command that exits zero while the signalled command's work is still alive. It runs in the same session after the exit is observed, and a zero exit is the violation `the command's work was still running after its handle reported it stopped`.

Every check runs under `CheckOptions.checkTimeout` (10 seconds by default), measured on the platform timer rather than the ambient `Clock`, and covering session acquisition and stream consumption as well as the call itself. A provider that never answers is convicted with a named violation instead of hanging the suite, and it is convicted under a frozen test clock too.

The checks run through `RemoteChildProcessSpawner.layer`, because a provider that satisfies the interface but not the adapter is of no use to a caller, and each check gets a fresh session so a check that leaves one unusable cannot decide the next. The optional capabilities are checked only when the provider declares them: an absent `ping`, `kill`, or `stdin` is a documented absence, not a defect.

## Sandbox

`Session` is a machine contract, not just a command transport. Its file operations and spawned commands must see the same tree.

| Obligation        | Required behavior                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| default directory | `spawn(command, {})` runs in `Session.workdir`                                                                                                  |
| relative cwd      | a relative `cwd` is taken under `workdir`, never under the transport's own directory                                                            |
| standard input    | `spawn` delivers `options.stdin` bytes as the command's complete input; a transport with no input channel stages a workspace file and redirects |
| parent creation   | `writeFile` creates missing parent directories                                                                                                  |
| absence           | `readFile` fails with `ProviderError.code === "not_found"` when the path is absent                                                              |
| contents          | file contents cross as bytes and round-trip unchanged                                                                                           |
| optional control  | `ping` keeps the spawner-level meaning; a declared `kill` ends the command and everything it started, not only the shell that wrapped it        |

```ts
import { Sandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const useMachine = Effect.scoped(
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    const session = yield* provider.acquire("run:01J...")
    yield* session.writeFile(`${session.workdir}/src/input.bin`, bytes)
    const process = yield* session.spawn("test -f src/input.bin", {})
    return yield* process.exitCode
  })
)
```

`Provider.acquire(key)` is scoped. Acquisition registers teardown as a finalizer of that scope; closing the scope is the only lifecycle end exposed to the caller. The stable key lets an implementation deterministically name and reattach a crash-left machine when it can. Image, memory, network policy, and other machine shape belong to provider construction, not `acquire`.

Vercel, Daytona, Cloudflare, AWS, and Microsandbox tolerate teardown failures and log Warn records containing only the adapter's provider name, operation, and error code. Error messages and SDK causes are omitted. For teardown diagnostics, explicitly instrument the injected SDK's release method and redact captured errors before emitting a record.

`ContainerSandbox`, `KubernetesSandbox`, and `AwsSandbox` stamp a SHA-256 fingerprint of the provider, full session key, and requested machine configuration in `smithers.dev/sandbox-fingerprint` labels or tags. Reattachment requires matching metadata; missing, malformed, or mismatched inspection data fails with `unavailable` before starting, executing in, or deleting the candidate. This also applies before replacing terminal Pods or stopping duplicate ECS tasks. Leftovers created before fingerprinting must be removed explicitly before that key can be acquired again. Container image, workdir, and network mode and the Pod image and explicit service account are also checked against inspection output. With no `createArgs`, reattachment rejects host-networked or privileged Pods and host bind mounts in containers or hostPath volumes in Pods. The fingerprint includes all `createArgs`, environment, network, and role options; it is a configuration identity check, not attestation against an administrator who can rewrite provider metadata.

Every bundled provider derives its machine's name from the session key the same way: the key's leading name-safe characters, for the operator reading a container or process list, plus a 64-bit digest of the whole key. The digest is what keeps `a/b` and `a-b` on separate machines, and what keeps two keys that merely start alike apart. It is a checksum and not a cryptographic one, so 64 bits over the whole key is the claim rather than "collision proof", and because the slug IS durable machine identity, changing it orphans whatever is running under the old names.

Standard input for a transport with no input channel is staged under a session private directory in the workspace, `.smthrs-stdin`, under an unguessable name, and its removal is a finalizer of the spawn's scope rather than a `rm` appended to the command. The finalizer is registered before the first byte is written, so a write that fails partway still has its partial file taken away: no provider writes a file atomically, and `AwsSandbox` sends one remote round trip per `ExecTransport.chunkBytes` bytes. A killed or interrupted command therefore does not leave the caller's script, patch, or credential blob on the machine, and a reattached session cannot read a previous incarnation's staging file by guessing its name. What is guaranteed is the unguessable name and the scope-bound removal: the staging file is created through the session's own `writeFile`, so its mode is the machine's umask like any other file the session writes.

`commandProvider(provider, options)` projects the lifecycle back onto the spawn-only provider. Existing `RemoteChildProcessSpawner` adapters, `SandboxHealth.make`, `SandboxSupervision`, and `ProviderConformance` then compose unchanged. `options.provides` declares `kill` and `ping` before acquisition, because the projected provider must expose those capabilities statically; `stdin` is not among them, because delivering it is an obligation of every session rather than a capability a session may lack. A supervision retire-and-reopen cycle acquires a new generation; an older generation's late finalizer cannot clear the newer held session.

`fileSystem(session)` uses `Session.readFile` and `Session.writeFile` for byte transfer. It derives `exists`, `stat`, `makeDirectory`, `readDirectory`, `remove`, `rename`, `realPath`, and `readLink` with POSIX `sh` probes. Entries in `session.files` override the derived operations one by one, and an override is installed through the workdir resolver rather than beside it, so a native operation receives the rooted path without re-implementing the rule. Both arguments are rooted where both are paths the machine must reach (`rename`, `copyFile`, `link`); `symlink` is the exception, because its first argument is the text stored inside the link and POSIX resolves a relative one against the link's own directory, so rooting it would move where the link pointed. Other `FileSystem` operations retain `makeNoop`'s explicit refusal rather than simulating watches, open handles, or temporary directories.

The probe surface is intentionally honest. `stat` reports exact file size, but mode is `0` and times and ownership are absent. Directory output is line framed, so a newline in a filename is misread; the listing probe is `ls -1A` and never a bare `ls -A`, because POSIX `ls` columnizes when its output is a terminal and one provider's transport is a pseudo-terminal. Probes require the named POSIX utilities on the machine.

```ts
const machineHost = Sandbox.layerHost(provider, {
  session: "run:01J...",
  health: { deadline: "10 seconds" }
})
```

`layerHost` acquires one session for the layer scope and derives `ChildProcessSpawner`, `FileSystem`, and `Path` from it. This layer context is what a caller hands to an agent's standard filesystem and shell tools to place both on the same machine. When the provider supplies isolation, the machine boundary, not a path guard, denies ambient host access. Closing the layer scope runs provider teardown.

The layer also serves `SandboxHealth`, built with `SandboxHealth.make` over the held session, so a caller can ask whether the machine is still there. `options.health` is the probe's `ProbeOptions`; its `deadline` defaults to 5 seconds. A session without `ping` yields the noop probe, which always answers `Healthy`. That is not a claim the machine is alive; it says nothing is watching it.

What `layerHost` deliberately does not do is what `SandboxSupervision` does for the spawn-only seam: retire an unhealthy session and open a fresh one behind the caller's back. That is right for a transport, where a command is the whole unit of work, and wrong here, because the body holding these services has been writing to this machine. Swapping it mid-action would silently discard those writes and hand the body an empty tree that still looks like its workspace. A dead machine surfaces as a failure instead, and re-provisioning belongs to whoever retries the action, which acquires the session key again.

## SandboxConformance

```ts
import { SandboxConformance } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const violations = yield* SandboxConformance.check(provider, {
  provides: { kill: true, ping: true }
})
```

Each check acquires a fresh session. The file checks verify binary, empty, and 64 KiB byte round-trips, `not_found`, parent creation, the default workdir and a relative `cwd`, environment delivery, standard input delivery (verified through `readFile`, so a pseudo-terminal transport is not penalized for its output), standard error arriving on one of the two streams, and a working release-then-reacquire cycle. Two checks deliberately cross surfaces: `files-reach-processes` writes through `writeFile` and measures the file with `wc -c` in a process, and `processes-reach-files` has a process produce a file that `readFile` must return, so a session serving files from anywhere but the machine its processes run on cannot pass. The suite then projects the provider through `Sandbox.commandProvider` and delegates spawn, exit, stdin, ping, and process-stop checks to `ProviderConformance`, whose kill check also runs the fixture's `survivor` probe: after a kill, a command that can still be found running on the machine is a violation even though its wrapper exited. Assert that the returned array is empty.

`CheckOptions.checkTimeout` bounds every check, its own and the delegated suite's alike, on the platform timer. The default fixture is `uniquePosixCommands`, whose sleep duration is this process's own, so two suites running side by side on one host cannot mistake each other's fixture for a survivor. That uniqueness is drawn from Web Crypto and never from a process id, because this module is part of a browser-bundleable package and a free `process` identifier survives a bundle to throw in a browser.

## Providers

One row per bundled provider. Every cell is read from the provider's source and its tests. "Byte-exact command output" is about a command's own `stdout` and `stderr`; file transfer is byte-exact on all nine.

| Provider              | What a machine is                                                                 | How the vendor surface arrives                                                          | Reattaches an existing machine on the same session key                                                                        | Declares `kill`                                                  | Byte-exact command output                            | Proven against                                                                     |

### DirectorySandbox

```ts
import { DirectorySandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const provider = DirectorySandbox.make({
  fs,
  spawner,
  root: "/var/tmp/smithers"
})
```

`acquire` first requires `ContainedSpawner.isContained(spawner)`: a raw spawner or a wrapper with only a kill deadline fails with `unavailable` before any directory or command is created. Use `NodeHost.layerContained()` or `BunHost.layerContained()` with a `ProcessLedger`; a custom host must supply a real platform lifecycle. The filesystem and spawner remain injected values, so this package has no production platform dependency.

Acquisition creates the deterministic scratch directory, commands run there by default, and native host file operations serve it. Explicit `kill` and every spawn-scope finalizer delegate to the contained handle's `kill({ killSignal })`, including after the target's exit was observed. Cleanup failure fails scope release. The provider never signals a numeric handle pid itself: on POSIX that pid names the supervisor, while the exit code belongs to the target.

The supplied POSIX lifecycle cleans up the owned process group even after a natural target exit, including a background child that keeps output open. Explicit stopping while the target is still alive also attempts to stop descendants that escaped into another process group. That extra ancestry sweep uses revalidated positive PIDs and is best effort; automatic cleanup after natural exit does not promise to recover deliberately escaped sessions. Closing the session removes its scratch directory after process cleanup.

Each child receives only the host's `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `LC_*`,
`TERM`, `TMPDIR`, and `SHELL`, plus names explicitly declared in the spawn's
`env`. Undeclared provider keys, tokens, and other ambient variables are
withheld. An explicitly declared name is delivered even when it looks
credential-bearing.

This is a trusted local workspace backend, **not a security boundary**. A spawned process is not confined to the scratch directory and can address whatever its host credentials permit. Use it for local composition, tests, or CI placement where the body is trusted.

### ContainerSandbox

```ts
import { ContainerSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const provider = ContainerSandbox.make({
  spawner,
  image: "node:22"
})
```

The default CLI is `docker`; set `program: "podman"` for Podman or name a compatible wrapper. Network access is disabled by default with `--network none`; setting `network` to another engine mode is an explicit egress opt-in. `acquire` deterministically names the container, runs `create` then `start`, and reattaches when that name already exists: a refused create is followed by `container inspect`, and the returned configuration and ownership fingerprint must match before reattachment. Commands, reads, and writes all travel through `exec` to the same guest workdir. The scope finalizer runs `rm --force`, ending the container and everything still inside it.

Creation environment values travel through `--env-file /dev/stdin`. The host must expose `/dev/stdin`; values containing CR, LF, or NUL fail with `spawn_error` before creation because the CLI env-file format cannot represent them. Per-command environment operands travel as a base64 line on exec stdin, followed by the command's original stdin bytes. The guest shell reads that line before starting the command. The guest image needs `base64` as well as `sh` and `env`. Environment values are absent from local CLI argv.

The exec's own shell is named absolutely and a caller's environment travels as an `env(1)` prefix on the inner shell, never as `--env` on the exec and never through `export`. Both rules exist for the same reason: the engine resolves an exec's argv through the exec environment's `PATH`, so a caller's `PATH` override would otherwise break the wrapper before the command ran, and `export` refuses a name the session contract accepts (`a-b=1`) and would abort the whole line. Every shell the provider starts for itself is absolute for that same reason, workspace preparation, file reads and writes, and signal delivery included, since `options.env` is applied to the whole container. A spawn value of `undefined` deletes the variable with `env -u` rather than merely omitting it, so a name the container was created with is genuinely gone from the command's environment; every `-u` precedes every assignment, because `env` stops reading options at its first operand.

Killing the local `docker exec` client does not reliably signal the guest process. Each spawned command therefore writes its guest pid to a session-private pidfile. `kill` starts a second guest command that plants a cancellation marker first and only then waits for, reads, and signals the recorded pid, walking descendants through `/proc` and signalling children before the root. The marker comes first because the wrapper writes its pid before it reads the marker: a wrapper with no pid on disk has not reached the marker check yet and must see it, and a wrapper that has passed the check has left a pid to signal. Reading the pid first left a window in which the wrapper started the command between the empty read and the marker being written, and the kill reported success anyway. Acquisition wipes the pidfile directory before reuse, so reattachment cannot target stale pids.

### KubernetesSandbox

```ts
import { KubernetesSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const provider = KubernetesSandbox.make({
  spawner,
  image: "node:22",
  context: "orbstack",
  namespace: "smithers-runs",
  serviceAccount: "runner",
  resources: {
    requests: { cpu: "250m", memory: "512Mi" },
    limits: { cpu: "2", memory: "2Gi" }
  }
})
```

`acquire` derives the Pod name from the session key (prefix `smthrs-sbx-`, lowercased, bounded to 63 characters with the key's digest kept), runs `kubectl run` with `--restart Never` and `sleep infinity`, inspects an `AlreadyExists` Pod and reattaches only when its configuration and owner match, waits for the `Ready` condition with a 300 second timeout, and prepares the workdir and a session-private pidfile directory. Options `kubectl run` has no flag for (`serviceAccount`, `nodeSelector`, `resources`) travel as a strategic-merge `--overrides` document; `context`, `namespace`, and `kubeconfig` prefix every invocation. The scope finalizer runs `kubectl delete pod --force --grace-period=0`, and a Pod that was created but never became Ready or could not prepare its workspace is deleted the same way.

When creation environment values are supplied, `kubectl run --dry-run=client -o json` renders the Pod, then `kubectl create -f -` receives the manifest with those values on stdin. Per-command environment operands use a base64 line on exec stdin before the command's stdin bytes. Neither path puts environment values in local CLI argv.

Commands run through `kubectl exec` under an absolute `/bin/sh`, in the requested `cwd`, with the caller's environment applied by `env(1)` in front of a second absolute `/bin/sh`; a spawn value of `undefined` deletes a Pod-wide variable with `env -u` rather than leaving it in place, and every `-u` precedes every assignment because `env` stops reading options at its first operand. The provider's own preparation, read, write, and signal shells are absolute too, since `options.env` reaches the whole Pod and a `PATH` override would otherwise disable them. Files travel through the same channel as base64: a read runs guest `base64`, a write pipes base64 into `base64 -d` on the exec's stdin after `mkdir -p` of the parent, so file contents cross the text boundary and remain byte exact. `kill` is the `ContainerSandbox` design, a pidfile per command, the same cancellation marker, and a second exec that signals descendants before the recorded pid. `ping` is `kubectl exec <pod> -- true`.

Isolation is the cluster's, not the provider's: the image, the service account, and the namespace's policies decide what a Pod can reach, and the provider only forwards the shaping options above. The image must carry `sh`, `env`, and `base64`. The Ready timeout is fixed. The real-backend suite runs against the `orbstack` context and skips wherever `kubectl cluster-info` does not answer there.

### JustBashSandbox

```ts
import { JustBashSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const provider = JustBashSandbox.make({
  bash: interpreter, // a just-bash instance mounted over the same tree as `fs`
  fs,
  root: "/workspace"
})
```

`acquire` creates `root/<slug>` through the injected `FileSystem` and removes it, recursively, when the scope closes. Commands go to `bash.exec` with the session workdir as `cwd` (a relative spawn `cwd` is rooted under it), the defined entries of the spawn environment, and any spawn `stdin` rendered as a latin1 string under `stdinKind: "bytes"`, the byte representation the interpreter documents; reads, writes, and the native `files` operations (`exists`, `stat`, `readDirectory`, `makeDirectory`, `remove`, `rename`, `realPath`, `readLink`) go to the injected `FileSystem`. The caller must mount the interpreter and that service on the same tree: in a browser this normally means just-bash and `BrowserFileSystem` both view the same ZenFS volume. `ping` always succeeds. There is no machine to reattach; a same-key acquire recreates the directory with a recursive `makeDirectory`, which leaves whatever the mounted tree already holds in place.

This provider is a workspace boundary, **not a security boundary**. An interpreted command can address anything its shared virtual filesystem permits. Runs are serialized behind one permit, because just-bash has one mutable filesystem view. A successful spawn completes before it returns, stdout and stderr each replay at most one UTF-8 encoded chunk, and `isRunning` is already `false` by the time a caller can observe the adapted handle. There is no signal delivery, no separately spawned process pipeline, and no incremental output, so sessions omit `kill` and the conformance kill check is skipped for them. The suite runs the interpreter as a real shell over the same real directory the injected `FileSystem` serves, and the slice is proven assignable from a real just-bash 3.2.0 `Bash` instance, with a negative control against the old shape.

Cancelling or timing out `spawn` stops waiting. An executing command retains the shared permit until its promise settles; a cancelled queued command never starts. A hung interpreter leaves later commands queued, but callers can still cancel. Cancellation neither signals the interpreter nor rolls back its effects, and closing the session scope removes the workspace even while a command is running. See [Limits](./limits.md) for cancellation and binary output handling.

### MicrosandboxSandbox

```ts
import { MicrosandboxSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"
import * as Microsandbox from "microsandbox"

const provider = MicrosandboxSandbox.make({
  sdk: Microsandbox,
  image: "oven/bun:1",
  persistence: "sticky",
  cpus: 2,
  memoryMib: 2048,
  idleTimeoutSecs: 600,
  disableNetwork: true
})
```

The machine name is `smthrs-msb-<slug>`. `acquire` configures the builder and calls `create`; when the SDK answers `sandboxAlreadyExists` it fetches the handle and connects when the machine is running or starts it (detached, for sticky sessions) when it is stopped. Machine creation is registered as a scoped resource before guest setup, so a microVM that boots but cannot prepare its workspace is stopped. `ephemeral` persistence, the default, stops the machine when the scope closes; `sticky` deliberately leaves it running so the next acquire of the same session key can reconnect, and only stops a sticky machine it created but could not prepare. Commands run through `execStreamWith(shell, ["-c", command])` with the workdir applied per execution, because Microsandbox validates a builder workdir before the selected image has booted, and the single-drain handle is collected exactly once; output comes back through the byte-typed `stdoutBytes()` and `stderrBytes()`. Writes use the SDK's byte-safe `fs().write` and reads its byte-typed `fs().read`; standard input rides the exec builder's own `stdinBytes` channel. `ping` reads `/etc/hostname`.

`image` and `snapshot` are exclusive; naming both fails with `unavailable` before any vendor call. Output is collected after the command finishes: one stdout chunk, one stderr chunk, no streaming, and no `kill`. A stopped ephemeral machine is gone with its files. The real-backend suite runs the conformance check against a real microVM only where the `microsandbox` binary answers `--version` and the host can actually boot one.

`environment` plants the workspace's Nix environment in the microVM and runs every command under it:

```ts
const provider = MicrosandboxSandbox.make({
  sdk: Microsandbox,
  persistence: "sticky",
  environment: { flake: flakeText, lock: lockText, attr: "ci" }
})
```

The flake and lock are text because this package reads no host files: whoever composes the provider reads them, from a checkout, a fixture, or wherever else the environment is declared. With an environment and no `image` the microVM boots `nixos/nix`. `acquire` writes the files to `<workdir>/.smithers/nix` (or `directory`), runs `nix develop path:<directory>[#attr] --command true` once so the closure is realised before the session is handed out, and then runs each command as `nix develop … --command <shell> -c <command>`. A flake that does not evaluate fails the acquire with `unavailable`, carrying `nix develop`'s exit code and stderr, and the booted machine is stopped. Boot stays fast through the store: a `sticky` session keeps the realised closure across acquires, and a `snapshot` taken after the warm boots with it already realised.

### VercelSandbox

```ts
import { VercelSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"
import * as vercel from "@vercel/sandbox"

const provider = VercelSandbox.make({
  sdk: vercel,
  token,
  teamId,
  projectId,
  timeoutMs: 30 * 60_000,
  maxDurationMs: 60 * 60_000,
  runtime: "node22"
})
```

The machine name is `smthrs-<slug>`, lowercased. `acquire` calls `Sandbox.getOrCreate` with `persistent: true` and `resume: true`, so a name that already exists is resumed with its filesystem, and the scope finalizer calls `stop()`, which leaves the persistent sandbox in place for the next acquire. Credentials resolve in a fixed order: an explicit `oidcToken` or `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` wins; otherwise `token`, `teamId`, and `projectId` are sent together or not at all; the environment consulted is `options.env`, never `process.env`. Vercel limits the timeout accepted by one create request to five minutes, so longer requested lifetimes create at that ceiling and then call `extendTimeout` with only the remaining duration, because that API extends by its argument rather than setting an absolute target. Commands run through `runCommand` as `sh -c` and never `sh -lc`: a login shell sources profile scripts, and anything those print lands ahead of the command's own standard output, which callers parse as data. `commandEnv` sits under the per-spawn environment. A read drains `readFile`'s stream, string or bytes, into one buffer, and `null` is `not_found`; a write runs `mkdir -p` for the parent and calls `writeFiles`.

`timeoutMs` must be a positive finite number, `maxDurationMs` is a caller-owned cap checked before any vendor request, and `workdir` must be absolute; each refusal is a `spawn_error` raised before anything is acquired. Output arrives after the command finishes, so there is no streaming and no `kill`; `runCommand` has no input channel, so standard input is staged as a workspace file and redirected. There is no real-backend suite; the provider is proven against a fake that keeps the vendor API shapes and runs every command through a real shell against real files.

### DaytonaSandbox

```ts
import { DaytonaSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const provider = DaytonaSandbox.make({
  sdk: daytona, // a configured `new Daytona(...)` client
  workdir: "/home/daytona/workspace",
  startTimeoutSeconds: 120
})
```

The machine name is `smthrs-<slug>`, lowercased. `acquire` calls `get(name)` first; a 404 creates a sandbox with that name, and an existing one is started with `startTimeoutSeconds`. Creation or attachment is registered as a scoped resource before start and workspace preparation, so any later failure still runs the blocking delete finalizer, `delete(sandbox, deleteTimeoutSeconds, true)`. The workdir is `options.workdir` or the sandbox's own `getWorkDir()`, and either must be absolute. Commands run through `process.executeCommand(command, cwd, env)`. Daytona's byte-native download and stream-upload operations serve file transfer: `downloadFile` for reads, with `FILE_NOT_FOUND` mapped to `not_found`, and `uploadFileStream` for writes.

Teardown deletes the sandbox, so nothing survives a normal release; only a crash-left sandbox is found again by name. `executeCommand` returns one `result` string with no stderr field on the wire, so a command's standard error arrives merged into standard output rather than separately, and output arrives after the command finishes; there is no streaming and no `kill`, and standard input is staged as a workspace file and redirected. There is no real-backend suite; the provider is proven against a fake that keeps the documented API and error shapes (unverified live) and runs every command through a real shell against real files.

### AwsSandbox

```ts
import { ECS } from "@aws-sdk/client-ecs"
import { AwsSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const provider = AwsSandbox.make({
  sdk: new ECS({ region: "us-west-2" }),
  exec: { spawner },
  region: "us-west-2",
  cluster: "smithers",
  subnets: ["subnet-0abc"],
  securityGroups: ["sg-0abc"],
  image: "ghcr.io/acme/runner:1",
  taskRoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/runner-task",
  executionRoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/runner-exec"
})
```

`acquire` first looks for the machine a previous acquire of the same key left running: one `ListTasks` call with the `startedBy` tag derived from the key and no desired-status filter. AWS requires `startedBy` to be the only filter and documents that a PENDING desired-status filter returns nothing. Omitting `desiredStatus` uses the RUNNING default, which still returns a provisioning task whose desired status is RUNNING while its `lastStatus` is PENDING. This is how a host that died between `RunTask` and its finalizer recovers the not-yet-ready task instead of stranding it. `DescribeTasks` requests `include: ["TAGS"]` and verifies every candidate before adoption or cleanup. Reattaching an externally supplied `taskDefinition` requires an explicit revision (for example `family:7` or a revision-qualified ARN) matching the described task definition; an unversioned family may still create a fresh task. The lowest verified ARN is adopted and waited for if it is not ready; verified duplicates under that key are stopped before provisioning, so a key never accumulates machines. Otherwise it calls `RunTask` with `enableExecuteCommand: true`, `launchType: "FARGATE"`, and that `startedBy`, polls `DescribeTasks` with exponential backoff (capped at 10 seconds, `maxPollAttempts` default 60) until the task is `RUNNING` and its agent is, and registers `StopTask` on the scope; an adopted task is released the same way, so closing the scope always leaves nothing behind. A task that reaches `STOPPED` first fails with `unavailable`; an exhausted poll budget fails with `timeout`. Supplying an image reuses an adopted task’s definition without registering a revision. Recovery lists ACTIVE definitions in the generated family with `ListTaskDefinitions` (including all pages), deregisters stale revisions, and deregisters the adopted revision after stopping the task. The injected SDK and IAM policy must allow `ListTaskDefinitions` for image recovery. A fresh task registers a minimal Fargate task definition and deregisters it after the task finalizer runs: family `smthrs-<startedBy>`, `sleep infinity`, `initProcessEnabled`, `cpu` 256 and `memory` 512 by default, container `sandbox`. `env` reaches the task as container overrides, which needs a `container` name or an image-generated definition. Supplying `taskDefinition` and `env` without `container` fails acquisition with `spawn_error` before any SDK request. A spawn's own environment is applied by `env(1)` in front of an absolute `/bin/sh` rather than by `export`, which refuses a name the session contract accepts. An undefined spawn value uses portable `env -u` to delete the inherited task variable. `ping` describes the task again and requires the same readiness.

Commands, reads, and writes travel through `ExecTransport`: `aws ecs execute-command --interactive`, driven through the injected spawner, because ECS Exec is two halves and the ECS API implements only one. `ExecuteCommand` opens an SSM session and returns its metadata; the data channel that carries output and status is the Session Manager protocol, which the AWS CLI speaks by delegating to `session-manager-plugin`. The session is a pseudo-terminal, so standard error arrives interleaved on standard output and line endings are normalized; the plugin exits zero whatever the remote command did, so every command is wrapped to print its own status line under a per-command nonce, and a session that ends without one is `aborted`, never a success. Reads come back as guest `base64` and writes go in as base64 slices bounded by `chunkBytes` (default 3072 bytes before encoding), so file contents are byte-exact despite the terminal. `chunkBytes` is validated when the session is acquired and must be a whole number from 1 through 65536 bytes; an invalid value is refused with `spawn_error` naming that range. Each slice travels on `ExecTransport.streamingSpawner` stdin. The range bounds per-session buffering; payload bytes never enter `--command`. Standard input is staged as a workspace file and redirected. `kill` records each command's guest pid in a session-private pidfile and signals it and its descendants through a second session; closing a spawn's scope does the same for a command not yet seen to end.

File writes, spawns with stdin, and spawns with a nonempty environment require `exec.streamingSpawner`. This optional adapter receives the AWS CLI command descriptor, including routing flags and `options.stdin`. It must deliver stdin byte-exactly to the guest, close it at EOF, keep it out of local argv, and disable input echo. Output uses the existing status framing. A normal AWS CLI spawner does not satisfy this contract. Without the adapter these operations fail with `ProviderError` code `unavailable` before transfer; commands without input and file reads still use `exec.spawner`. Environment operands use a base64 line on streaming stdin, and command stdin is staged through the streaming file-write path.

Without an `exec` transport the session still provisions and tears down tasks but refuses `spawn`, `readFile`, and `writeFile` with `unavailable`, naming the missing transport, and the conformance suite records every obligation it cannot meet; with both CLI and streaming adapters it passes the suite in full. Honest limits: the host running the provider needs the `aws` CLI and `session-manager-plugin` installed; a command's standard error cannot be separated from its output; and no live cluster is driven by the package's own suite, so the transport is proven against a fake that reproduces the plugin's banner, footer, carriage returns, and zero exit over a real local shell.

### CloudflareSandbox

```ts
import { getSandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox"
import { CloudflareSandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"

const provider = CloudflareSandbox.make({
  sdk: { getSandbox },
  binding: env.SANDBOX,
  execution: "exec",
  sleepAfter: "10m"
})
```

The Worker binding is the credential and the infrastructure handle. `acquire` resolves the Durable Object whose id is the session slug, with `enableDefaultSession: false` so the SDK's implicit shell session is never opened, forwards `keepAlive` and `sleepAfter` only when set, registers `destroy()` on the scope, and creates the workdir. In `exec` mode a command is `sandbox.exec` and its completed result; in `process` mode it is `startProcess`, then `waitForExit`, then `getLogs`; a process that reports no exit status on either surface fails with `spawn_error` rather than being given one. File payloads use the SDK's base64 encoding and the text is read from the result's `content` field, which preserves arbitrary bytes without importing host modules. `FILE_NOT_FOUND` is `not_found`. `ping` runs `exec("true")` in the workdir.

This provider does not create infrastructure. The Durable Object namespace, its container image, and the Worker that holds the binding are deployed by the caller, and the binding is the credential; there is nothing to configure here beyond it. Output arrives after the command completes in both modes, so there is no streaming and no `kill`; the exec options carry no input channel at 0.12.9, so standard input is staged as a workspace file and redirected. The finalizer destroys the object, so a normal release discards its files; only a crash-left object is found again by id. There is no real-backend suite; both execution modes are proven against a fake binding that runs every command through a real shell against real files.

## Limits

Two operations here are bounded and the rest is sized by the host's heap.
[Limits](./limits.md) states which is which, per operation and per provider,
and names the providers whose command output is not byte exact.

## Browser support

`@smthrs/sandbox` bundles as a browser entry point. The probe only runs the effect a provider hands it, and host access stays behind the provider layer. No module reads a host global; the conformance fixture's per-process uniqueness comes from Web Crypto rather than a process id, because a free `process` identifier survives bundling and throws in a browser.
