/**
 * Builds a provider backed by Cloudflare Sandbox Durable Objects.
 *
 * The Worker binding is the credential and infrastructure handle. Acquiring a
 * session resolves its key-derived Durable Object id, disables the SDK's
 * implicit default shell session, and registers `destroy()` on the acquiring
 * scope. `exec` mode uses the completed command result. `process` mode waits
 * for the detached handle and fetches its logs before it reports an outcome,
 * and a handle that reports no exit status at all is a provider failure, not
 * an invented one.
 *
 * The SDK's command options carry no input channel, so `spawn` stages
 * `options.stdin` as a workspace file and redirects the command from it, and
 * a relative `cwd` is rooted at the session workdir. File payloads use the
 * SDK's base64 encoding and the text is read from the result's `content`
 * field. This preserves arbitrary bytes without importing host modules.
 *
 * Command output is not byte-exact here. The SDK reports a command's stdout
 * and stderr as strings, so what this provider streams is those strings
 * re-encoded as UTF-8: a command whose output is not valid UTF-8, such as a
 * tarball or a compiled binary written to stdout, comes back changed. File
 * transfer is byte-exact regardless, so a caller that needs bytes has the
 * command write a file and reads it back with `readFile`.
