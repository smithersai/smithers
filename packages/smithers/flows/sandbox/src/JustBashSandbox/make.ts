/**
 * Builds a provider whose machines are just-bash workspaces in one virtual
 * filesystem.
 *
 * Each session key gets a subdirectory below `root`. Commands run through the
 * interpreter's `exec`, while reads, writes, and native file operations use
 * the injected `FileSystem`. The caller must mount the interpreter and that
 * service on the same tree. In a browser this normally means just-bash and
 * `BrowserFileSystem` both view the same ZenFS volume.
 *
 * `spawn` hands `exec` the session workdir as `cwd`, rooting a relative `cwd`
 * there first; the defined entries of the spawn environment as `env`, which
 * just-bash merges into the interpreter's environment for that one call; and
 * `options.stdin` as `stdin` with `stdinKind: "bytes"`, the latin1 byte-string
 * form just-bash forwards verbatim, so binary input reaches the command
 * unchanged. Environment deletion is refused with `spawn_error` before exec,
 * because the injected interpreter interface can only merge string values.
 * The cross-surface checks a session must pass, a process reading
 * a file `writeFile` put there and `readFile` returning what a process wrote,
 * rely on nothing beyond the `<` and `>` redirections just-bash documents.
 *
 * This provider is a workspace boundary, not a security boundary. An
 * interpreted command can address anything its shared virtual filesystem
 * permits. Runs are serialized because just-bash has one mutable filesystem
 * view. Cancelling a spawn stops waiting; an exec already started continues
 * holding the permit until it settles. A cancelled queued command never runs.
 * A hung interpreter keeps later commands queued, but their callers can still
 * cancel. Closing the session scope removes its workspace even if exec is
 * still running. A successful spawn completes before it returns, stdout and
 * stderr each replay at most one UTF-8 encoded chunk, and `isRunning` is already
 * false by the time a caller can observe the adapted handle. There is no signal
 * delivery, separately spawned process pipeline, or incremental output. Consequently sessions omit `kill`,
 * and `SandboxConformance` skips its kill-and-survivor check for this provider
 * instead of reporting a violation.
