 * signalled through the same pid walk, so a scope cannot close on a

 * the plumbing that starts it, and a caller's `PATH` override must not keep
 * the wrapper's own shell from starting. `env(1)`, not `export`: `export` is
 * a special builtin, so a name it refuses would abort the whole script.
 * `checkEnvironmentNames` refuses non-identifier names up front, because the
 * inner shell rebuilds its environment from shell identifiers as it starts.
