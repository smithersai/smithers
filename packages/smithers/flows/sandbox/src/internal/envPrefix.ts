 *
 * GNU coreutils, busybox, and BSD `env` all support `-u`, so an undefined
 * value deletes a variable the machine was created with instead of silently
 * keeping it: `undefined` means the same "remove this one" for a remote
 * command that it means for a local one. Every `-u` precedes every
 * assignment, because `env` stops reading options at the first operand and
 * `env A=1 -u B prog` hands `-u` to `env` as the program to run.
