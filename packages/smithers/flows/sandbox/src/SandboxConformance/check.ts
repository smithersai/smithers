/**
 * Checks one provider against the `Sandbox` session contract.
 *
 * A provider package runs this in its own test suite and asserts the result
 * is empty, the way `ProviderConformance` is run for spawn-only transports.
 *
 * The file checks state the contract's own obligations: byte round-trips of
 * a small binary payload, an empty file, and a 64 KiB one; `not_found` for
 * absence; parent creation; the workdir default and a relative `cwd`;
 * environment delivery; deletion of inherited HOME or a typed refusal;
 * refusal of an environment name a guest shell would drop; standard input delivery; standard error delivery; and a working
 * session after release and reacquire. Two checks look across
 * surfaces on purpose. A session that served `readFile` from somewhere other
 * than the machine its processes run on would pass every file check and
 * every process check separately, so one check writes through `writeFile`
 * and measures the file with a process, and another produces a file with a
 * process and reads it back through `readFile`. The spawn checks are the
 * delegated `ProviderConformance` suite over `commandProvider`, so a session
 * provider is held to everything a spawn transport is, including that a
 * declared `kill` ends the command's work and not just its shell.
 *
 * Four more checks run only when the caller opts in, so a provider that makes
 * no such claim is not held to it. `provides.interrupt` runs
 * `interrupts-a-running-command`: a command and the background child it
 * started are interrupted two seconds before each would write a file, and
 * neither file may appear. `provides.ephemeral` runs
 * `releases-ephemeral-state`: a file written before release must be absent
 * after reacquiring the key. `isolation.hostSentinel` runs `hides-host-paths`
 * and `isolation.egressProbe` runs `refuses-egress`; see
 * {@link CheckOptions.isolation}. None of them is proof of a boundary on its
 * own: each is one observation, and a provider documents what it isolates.
