/**
 * Builds a sandbox provider whose machines are containers this host's
 * container engine runs.
 *
 * `acquire` creates a deterministically named container from the configured
 * image (`create` then `start`, holding it on `sleep infinity`) and serves
 * the session contract over `exec`: commands run under the guest's `sh`,
 * reads stream bytes out through `cat`, writes stream bytes in through the
 * exec's stdin, and closing the scope removes the container with force,
 * which also ends everything running inside it. A container the name already
 * holds — a crashed run's leftover — is reattached only when its ownership and configuration match, so
 * resuming a session key lands in the machine it had.
 *
 * `spawn` honors the whole session contract, not just the command line. A
 * command's `stdin` bytes travel on the exec's own input channel
 * (`--interactive`), a relative `cwd` is resolved under {@link Session.workdir}
 * before it reaches `--workdir` (which requires an absolute path), and both
 * shells in the chain name `/bin/sh` absolutely, because the engine resolves a
 * bare `sh` through the exec environment's `PATH` and a caller's `env`
 * override would otherwise break the wrapper before the command ever ran. For
 * the same reason the caller's variables travel through stdin to an `env(1)` prefix on the
 * inner shell rather than as `--env` on the exec: they belong to the command,
 * not to the plumbing that starts it. Closing a
 * spawn's scope is the process's lifetime ending: the local CLI client is torn
 * down and, unless the command was already observed to end, the guest process
 * is signalled through the same pid-walk `kill` uses, so a scope cannot close
 * on a still-running guest.
 *
 * Per-command `kill` is real, and it has to be indirect: signalling the local
 * CLI client does not reach the guest process (Docker's exec client detaches
 * from it), which is exactly the silent-no-op kill the conformance suite
 * exists to catch. So every spawned command records its own pid in a
 * session-private guest directory first, and `kill` execs a second command
 * that signals that pid and every descendant found under `/proc`. The pidfile
 * directory is wiped on acquire, so a reattached container cannot mis-target
 * a previous incarnation's pids.
