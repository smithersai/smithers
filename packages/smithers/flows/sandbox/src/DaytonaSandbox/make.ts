/**
 * Builds a provider backed by Daytona sandboxes.
 *
 * A name derived from the session key is looked up first. A
 * missing sandbox is created with that name, while an existing one is started
 * before use. Creation or attachment is registered as a scoped resource before
 * start and workspace preparation, so any later failure still runs the
 * blocking delete finalizer; a delete that fails is logged at Warn rather
 * than swallowed. Daytona's byte-native download and stream-upload operations
 * serve file transfer; shell execution creates missing parents.
 *
 * `process.executeCommand` answers with a single `result` string and an exit
 * code — the wire response carries no stderr field, and the execution
 * endpoint merges standard error into that one output (Daytona's own
 * error-handling documentation prints `result` as the error output). The
 * merged text is delivered on stdout, so text a command writes to stderr
 * still reaches the caller there, and the stderr stream stays empty rather
 * than fabricating a second copy of it.
 *
 * A relative spawn `cwd` is rooted at the session workdir per the session
 * contract, and `options.stdin` is delivered through a workspace file —
 * `executeCommand` takes a command line and nothing else, so the redirect in
 * `internal/stdinRedirect` is the only honest route.
 *
 * Command output is not byte-exact here. That `result` is a string, so what
 * this provider streams is the string re-encoded as UTF-8: a command whose
 * output is not valid UTF-8, such as a tarball or a compiled binary written to
 * stdout, comes back changed. File transfer is byte-exact regardless, so a
 * caller that needs bytes has the command write a file and reads it back with
 * `readFile`.
