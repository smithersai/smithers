/**
 * Acquires one machine for the layer's lifetime and serves the host surface

 * pure `Path`.
 *
 * These are the same tags the local platform bundles provide and the standard
 * tools consume, so handing this layer's context to `StandardFlows.filesystem`
 * and `StandardFlows.shell` places every file operation and every spawned
 * command an agent performs on the provisioned machine — coherently, because
 * both surfaces are views of the one session. Closing the layer scope runs the
 * provider's teardown.
 *
 * This is the provisioning story the workspace transaction's documentation
 * calls future work: the machine boundary, not a path guard, is what denies
 * ambient host access here, which is why the sandbox-backed services are
 * served bare rather than kernel-decorated.
 *
 * `SandboxHealth` is served alongside them, probing the machine this layer
 * holds, so a caller can ask whether it is still there. What this layer
 * deliberately does NOT do is what `SandboxSupervision` does for the spawn-only
 * seam: retire an unhealthy session and open a fresh one behind the caller's
 * back. That is right for a transport, where a command is the whole unit of
 * work, and wrong here, because the body holding these services has been
 * WRITING to this machine. Swapping it mid-action would silently discard those
 * writes and hand the body an empty tree that still looks like its workspace.
 * A dead machine surfaces as a failure instead, and re-provisioning belongs to
 * whoever retries the action, which acquires the session key again.
