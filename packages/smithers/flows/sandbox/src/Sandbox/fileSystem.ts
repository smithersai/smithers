/**
 * Builds an Effect `FileSystem` over one sandbox session.
 *
 * `readFile` and `writeFile` ride the session's own byte-typed operations.
 * Derived writes support only an omitted flag or `w`, with no mode. Other
 * flags and explicit modes fail with `BadArgument` before session access:
 * the transfer seam cannot guarantee atomic append, exclusive creation, or
 * creation permissions. Native write overrides receive the options unchanged.
 * Everything else is derived through portable `sh` probes over
 * `Session.spawn`: POSIX `test`, `wc -c`, `ls -1A`, `find`, `mkdir`, `rm`,
 * `mv`, and `dirname`, plus `readlink`/`readlink -f` and `find -mindepth`,
 * which POSIX omits but GNU, busybox, and the BSDs all ship — so any session
 * whose machine has a mainstream `sh` userland serves the whole surface with
 * no adapter work. An adapter that can do better supplies `Session.files`,
 * whose entries override the probes one operation at a time.
 *
 * Failure reasons mirror `NodeFileSystem` wherever a script can tell the
 * outcomes apart: absence is `NotFound`, an occupied `mkdir` target is
 * `AlreadyExists`, a directory in `rename`'s way or a listed non-directory is
 * `BadResource`, and a path an unsearchable ancestor hides fails `exists`
 * with `PermissionDenied`. What a probe cannot classify stays `Unknown`; the
 * one deliberate divergence is `readLink` of an existing non-link, which
 * answers `BadArgument` where Node surfaces its unmapped `EINVAL` as
 * `Unknown`.
 *
 * The derived surface is deliberately partial, on the `makeNoop` base: an
 * operation with no meaningful remote form (a watch, an open file handle, a
 * temp directory) answers with the platform's own refusal rather than a
 * plausible lie, the same stance the workspace transaction's filesystem takes.
 *
 * Relative paths resolve against {@link Session.workdir} before they reach the
 * session or an override, so a body that writes `report.txt` lands in the
 * machine's workspace on every backend; the session contract itself stays
 * absolute-only. An override is installed through the resolver rather than
 * beside it, so an adapter's native operation gets the rooted path without
 * having to re-implement the rule.
 *
 * Honest limits of the probe dialect: `stat` reports no mode, no times, and no
 * owner (the portable shell cannot name them; its `size` is exact, from the
 * machine's `stat` where it has one and a byte count otherwise, and a size the
 * probe cannot read fails rather than reading as zero); `rename` replaces an
 * empty directory with a directory only where `mv` knows `-T`; a
 * directory entry whose name contains a newline is misread, because probe
 * output is line-framed. `stat` follows links the way the platform
 * implementations do, and reports `SymbolicLink` only for a dangling link.
