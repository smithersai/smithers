/**
 * The provisioned-machine contract and its projections.
 *
 * `RemoteChildProcessSpawner` carries commands to a machine something else
 * provisioned. This module owns the other half: `Provider.acquire` turns a
 * session key into a held {@link Session} — a machine with byte-typed file
 * transfer beside the same spawn — and every richer surface derives from that
 * one contract rather than being asked of each adapter:
 *
 * - {@link commandProvider} projects the lifecycle onto the spawner-level
 *   provider, so the spawner adapter, the health probe, supervision, and the
 *   provider conformance suite compose with a lifecycle provider unchanged.
 * - {@link fileSystem} serves Effect's `FileSystem` from a session: native
 *   reads and writes, everything else through strictly POSIX `sh` probes an
 *   adapter may override.
 * - {@link layerHost} holds one machine for a layer's lifetime and provides
 *   `ChildProcessSpawner | FileSystem | Path` from it — the host surface a
 *   flow body or an agent's standard tools consume, placed on the machine.
 *
 * `SandboxConformance` states the session contract as behavior;
 * `DirectorySandbox` and `ContainerSandbox` are the two in-repository
 * implementations, and vendor machines live in plugin packages built on the
 * same seam.
 *
