/**
 * Builds a sandbox provider whose machines are directories on this host.
 *
 * `acquire` creates one scratch directory per session key and serves the
 * session contract from it: `spawn` runs the command line through the host
 * spawner's shell with the directory as its default working directory — a
 * relative `cwd` is taken under it, the caller's `env` extends a narrow host
 * bootstrap environment, and `stdin` bytes become the command's whole standard
 * input — file transfer is the host filesystem, `kill` delegates to the
 * contained handle, and closing the scope stops its owned process group before
 * removing the directory. Acquisition refuses a spawner without a platform
 * lifecycle before creating a directory or starting a command.
 *
 * This is the trusted local backend — a workspace boundary, **not a security
 * boundary**. Nothing confines a spawned process to the directory; what the
 * provider gives you is the session shape itself, so a composition, a test,
 * or CI can run the placement machinery for real with no container runtime,
 * and the same composition swaps to `ContainerSandbox` or a vendor provider
 * where isolation matters.
