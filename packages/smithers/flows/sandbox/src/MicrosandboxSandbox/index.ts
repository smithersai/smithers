 * The Microsandbox microVM provider.
 *
 * A `Sandbox.Provider` that creates or reconnects to deterministic local
 * Microsandbox machines through an injected SDK slice. Guest commands stream
 * their output and can be signalled with their whole process tree, byte-safe
 * file transfer shares the same microVM, scope release owns teardown, and
 * every machine carries ownership labels that `reap` sweeps orphans by.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
