/**
 * Removes this owner's machines whose holder is no longer alive.
 *
 * Microsandbox's own database is the registry: machines are listed by the
 * `smithers.provider` and `smithers.owner` labels every `MicrosandboxSandbox`
 * machine carries, page by page, and each one's `smithers.holder` label is put
 * to `isAlive`. A machine whose holder is dead is stopped and removed under a
 * bounded graceful window, with a forced removal when that fails, whatever its
 * persistence: a sticky machine outlives its holder by design, and reaping is
 * how a host decides that holder is not coming back. Machines of other owners,
 * machines without a readable holder label, and machines this package did not
 * create are never touched.
 *
 * A caller's `retain` keeps a dead holder's machine it still wants, such as a
 * sticky workspace of a run that resumes after the restart; the resumed run
 * reattaches it and relabels it to the new holder.
 *
 * Just before a removal the machine is read again, and a machine whose holder
 * label changed since the listing is skipped: acquiring an existing machine
 * relabels it to the new holder, so a machine a live holder reattached in the
 * meantime survives. A reattach that lands between that second read and the
 * removal is not caught, so a host reaps at startup, before it acquires. A
 * machine that disappears on its own in between is skipped too.
 *
 * Every candidate is attempted. When any removal fails, the effect fails with
 * `unavailable` naming those machines, after the others have been removed.
