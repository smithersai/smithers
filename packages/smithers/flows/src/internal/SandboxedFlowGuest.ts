/**
 * The guest half of `SandboxedFlow`: the program that runs a child flow inside
 * the machine.
 *
 * `SandboxedFlow.execute` bundles the caller's entry module together with this
 * module and starts the bundle on the provisioned machine. The bundle's main
 * calls {@link run} with the entry module's exports and the guest environment,
 * and everything below is the runner protocol as the guest sees it: read the
 * request JSON the host wrote at `SMITHERS_SANDBOX_REQUEST_PATH`, find the
 * flow the request names among the entry's exports, decode the payload through
 * that flow's own payload schema, run the flow to completion, and write the
 * result JSON to `SMITHERS_SANDBOX_RESULT_PATH`.
 *
 * The composition the flow runs under is the smallest one in the tree that
 * drives a flow to completion with no host services: `FlowEngine.layerMemory`
 * as the runtime, `Action.layerImplementations` as the table the entry's
 * action implementations file themselves in, `Interpreter.layer` for the flow,
 * and a `Crypto` built on the platform's WebCrypto. The child completes inside
 * one guest process and the PARENT journals the whole sandboxed execution as
 * one durable action, so an in-guest SQLite journal would add `node:sqlite`,
 * the migration ladder, and a `Jj` stub to every bundle without changing the
 * durability the parent can observe.
 *
 * Failures split two ways on purpose. A flow that fails, a payload the schema
 * refuses, and an entry module that exports no flow of the requested tag are
 * all outcomes the protocol can state, so they are written as a `failed`
 * result and the process exits normally. A missing request path, an
 * unreadable request file, or a result that cannot be written are failures of
 * the protocol itself, so they throw, the process exits non-zero, and the host
 * reports the exit and the guest's stderr rather than a fabricated result.
