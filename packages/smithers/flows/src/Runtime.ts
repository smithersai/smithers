/**
 * Platform-independent composition for the durable flows runtime.
 *
 * The SQL client and host services are injected. No driver is opened here;
 * native entrypoints compose their matching database and platform layers.
 *
 * Construction is ordered by layer dependencies: the SQLite parent directory
 * is created before the database opens, migrations finish before any store is
 * built, the durable engine is built over those stores, and `registerFlows`
 * finishes before the resulting services are exposed. The engine's own
 * registration hook then re-arms durable clocks and deferred wakes, so a
 * persisted run cannot resume through this composition before its flow has
 * been registered.
