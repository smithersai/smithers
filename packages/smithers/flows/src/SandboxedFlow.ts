/**
 * Runs a child flow's own code inside a provisioned sandbox machine.
 *
 * `Sandbox.layerHost` places a body's SIDE EFFECTS on a machine: its file
 * operations and child processes go to one held session while its TypeScript
 * keeps running in the engine host. This module is the tier above that. The
 * child flow's code EXECUTES inside the guest: the entry module that declares
 * it is bundled into one self-contained file, the bundle is written into the
 * session's workspace beside a request JSON, the guest runtime runs it with
 * `SMITHERS_SANDBOX_REQUEST_PATH` and `SMITHERS_SANDBOX_RESULT_PATH` naming
 * the two files, and the result JSON comes back through the same session to be
 * validated against the flow's own success schema. Smithers 0.x had this tier
 * as `<Sandbox workflow={child}>`; the 1.0 shape keeps its runner protocol and
 * its env variable names and drops two of its mistakes: a provider is a
 * `Sandbox.Provider` VALUE passed in, never a string looked up in a registry,
 * and the authoring is `Flow.make` and `Action.make`, never a component.
 *
 * The runner protocol, as shipped:
 *
 * 1. The entry module is bundled with esbuild (`platform: "node"`, ESM) into
 *    `.smithers-sandbox/bundle.mjs` under the session's workdir, together with
 *    a small main that imports the entry and hands its exports to the guest
 *    runner in `internal/SandboxedFlowGuest.ts`.
 * 2. `.smithers-sandbox/request.json` carries `{ attempt, flow, executionId, payload }`,
 *    the payload encoded through `Schema.toCodecJson` of the flow's payload
 *    schema. `attempt` is a fresh nonce for each execution of the effect.
 * 3. The guest runtime, `node` unless {@link ExecuteOptions.runtime} says
 *    otherwise, runs the bundle with the workdir as its working directory and
 *    the two env variables set. The runner finds the flow by tag among the
 *    entry's exports, decodes the payload, runs the flow under an in-memory
 *    engine, and writes `.smithers-sandbox/result.json`: either
 *    `{ attempt, status: "succeeded", output }` with the success value encoded through
 *    the success schema's JSON codec, or `{ attempt, status: "failed", error }`.
 * 4. The host reads the result back, refuses a non-zero exit, an unparseable
 *    file, or a result the limits reject, decodes `output` through the same
 *    codec, and, when {@link ExecuteOptions.collectDiff} is set, reads the
 *    files the guest created or changed in the workspace and returns them,
 *    with the paths it deleted, as data beside the output.
 *
 * What the guest image must contain is a statement, not code: the runtime the
 * bundle is started with, `node` (22 or later) or `bun`, has to be on the
 * guest's `PATH`. Nothing here installs one. A missing runtime is reported as
 * a `guest_failed` failure that names it.
 *
 * The workspace diff is DATA, not an applied change. Applying it on the host,
 * or gating it behind review the way the 0.x component's `reviewDiffs` did, is
 * the caller's, and the review gate is the recorded follow-up of this pass.

 * and a changed file are collected, and a file present before and absent
 * after is listed in `deleted`. A provider whose `stat` reports no
 * modification time, such as the portable probe dialect, falls back to size
 * alone, so on it a same-size rewrite of a file that existed before the guest
 * ran, which only a REATTACHED workspace holds, is missed. A fresh workspace
 * holds nothing but the protocol's own files, so every file the child writes
