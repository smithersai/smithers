/**
 * The write boundary shared by the durable stores, deliberately free of
 * journal or Host knowledge. Queries go through Effect's `SqlClient`
 * directly; only writes come here.
 *
 * **The `write` contract.** `write` runs its effect inside one transaction
 * with transaction-scoped retries, and implementations MUST guarantee that
 * write transactions are mutually serialized: two concurrent `write`
 * transactions may not both commit results computed from snapshots that
 * exclude each other's writes. Consumers depend on this for correctness,
 * not just isolation hygiene — the engine store's cycle detector inserts an
 * edge and walks the ancestor graph inside one `write`, and its safety
 * argument ("of two edges that jointly close a cycle, exactly the later
 * one fails") holds only under serialized writers. SQLite satisfies the
 * contract with its single-writer transaction lock; a PostgreSQL-backed
 * implementation must run write transactions at `SERIALIZABLE` (and retry
 * `40001`) — plain READ COMMITTED does not satisfy this contract.
 *
 * **Acquisition.** Outermost writes sharing this service queue for one permit
 * BEFORE entering Effect SQL's masked connection acquisition, and they queue at
 * the caller's own interruptibility. An interruptible caller can therefore be
 * interrupted or time out while queued, and acquires nothing when it is: no
 * transaction is opened and the holder's permit is untouched. A caller that
 * masked interruption keeps waiting, which is what a cleanup write running in
 * a finalizer needs. The permit spans the whole retry loop and is released
 * after SQL finishes, before commit publication can start another write.
 *
 * **Nesting.** A `write` inside the client's open transaction joins it as a
 * savepoint and does not retry: a transient conflict dooms the enclosing
 * transaction's snapshot, so replaying the savepoint alone can never resolve
 * it. Only the outermost `write` retries, replaying the whole transaction
 * body verbatim against the committed state. Its retry classification
 * follows `cause` chains, so a transient failure keeps replaying the
 * outermost transaction even after a nested store has wrapped it in a domain
 * error that preserves `cause`. A store may redact driver payloads by keeping
 * only a new `DatabaseError({ code })` in that cause chain; its normalized
 * category is sufficient retry provenance.
