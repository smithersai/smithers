/**
 * Composition of per-package SQL migration sets over one migrations table.
 *
 * Every storage package above `@smthrs/database` owns its own tables and
 * therefore its own migrations, but they all migrate ONE database and record
 * their progress in ONE `flows_migrations` table. Effect's `Migrator` keys a
 * migration by a numeric id, so two packages that both ship an `0001_initial`
 * would either collide or — worse, if they were merged as a plain record —
 * silently shadow one another.
 *
 * A {@link MigrationSet} closes that hole by making the namespace part of the
 * identity: the package's `namespace` prefixes every migration name and its
 * `idOffset` reserves a disjoint block of migration ids. {@link loader} rejects
 * duplicate namespaces, duplicate offsets, an offset that is not a multiple of
 * {@link idBlock}, a local id outside one block, and two keys in one set that
 * realize the same id — `0001_first` beside `01_second` — so a mis-declared
 * package fails the migration rather than skipping a table.
 *
 * Blocks reintroduce a second way to skip one, which the loader handles:
 * `Migrator` decides what to run from a single high-water mark, so a set whose
 * id lands at or below the highest id the database already applied would be
 * assumed done and never run. Appends to an already installed package block
 * run transactionally in the loader before the ordinary forward pass. Missing
 * earlier migrations and newly introduced lower blocks remain refusals; a
 * package cannot insert a migration before its own applied high-water mark.
 * Global id zero on a fresh database is also applied by the loader.
 *
 * {@link run} wraps the whole migrator pass in the same transient-lock retry
 * the durable writer uses, so concurrent processes migrating one database
 * serialize instead of failing on the peer's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` lock.
 *
 * Derived contract: `docs/concepts/migration-ladder.md`.
