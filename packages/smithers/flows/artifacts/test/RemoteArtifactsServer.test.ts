/**
 * The chunked upload protocol against a real HTTP server.
 *
 * `RemoteArtifacts.test.ts` asserts the wire shape against a stub client, which
 * is where header-by-header claims belong. This suite asserts the two claims a
 * stub cannot make: that an interrupted transfer resumes over a real socket
 * from the prefix a real server kept, and that a real server refusing ranged
 * bodies is answered with one whole-blob `PUT` that actually lands.
 *
 * The store refuses any endpoint that is not HTTPS, because its options carry
 * credentials, and that guard is not weakened for a test. The client instead
 * runs on the real fetch transport with `FetchHttpClient.Fetch` rewriting the
 * declared `https://cas.test` authority onto the loopback server's port: real
 * requests, real bodies, real status codes, over a real connection, with TLS
 * termination the only thing standing in.
