/**
 * A cross-process lease on one lock file.
 *
 * The lock is a file created with `wx` (exclusive create) that holds a unique
 * owner token. The holder refreshes its mtime every `heartbeatEvery`; a lock
 * whose mtime is older than `staleAfterMs` belongs to a crashed or hard-killed
 * owner and is reclaimed. Reclaimers of one lock generation race for a `wx`
 * claim file first, so a stale generation is moved away at most once and a
 * fresh lock is never displaced. Acquisition is bounded by `acquireWithin`,
 * so a waiter fails with a typed error instead of waiting forever on a lock
 * nothing will release.
 *
 * | Setting          | Default     |
 * | ---------------- | ----------- |
 * | `heartbeatEvery` | 10 seconds  |
 * | `staleAfterMs`   | 60 000 ms   |
 * | `acquireWithin`  | 2 minutes   |
 * | `retryEvery`     | 25 millis   |
 *
 * The fence is bounded, not absolute: a holder stalled past `staleAfterMs`
 * (a suspended laptop, a stopped debugger) is reaped while it still runs. Its
 * heartbeat then logs `<label> was reclaimed while its holder was still
 * running`, and the protected effect continues unfenced.
 *
 * A directory at the lock path, left by a release that used an exclusive
 * `makeDirectory` as its lock, is treated as a lock with no readable owner:
 * it is reclaimed once its mtime is past `staleAfterMs`, and waited on
 * before that.
 *
 * The host needs exclusive `wx` file creation, `readFileString`, `stat` with
 * an mtime, `utimes`, `rename`, and `remove`. The claim file and the tombstone
 * a reclaim renames the stale lock to are siblings of the lock:
 * `<lockPath>.reclaim-<token>` and `<lockPath>.stale-<token>`.
