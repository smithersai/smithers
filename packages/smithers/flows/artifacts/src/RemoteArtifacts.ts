/**
 * The shared artifact tier: an {@link ArtifactStore.Service} spoken over HTTP.
 *
 * The wire protocol mirrors Bazel's dumb-HTTP remote cache, class
 * `HttpCacheClient` in `com.google.devtools.build.lib.remote.http`, which
 * documents it as: "CAS (Content Addressable Storage) blobs are stored under
 * the path `/cas/base16-key`", uploaded with `PUT`, downloaded with `GET`. We add
 * `HEAD /cas/{digest}` for a single existence probe and
 * `POST /cas/findMissing` for the batched one, because Bazel's HTTP client has
 * no `findMissingDigests` at all — it answers "everything is missing" and
 * re-uploads — and a batched probe is the whole reason
 * `MissingDigestsFinder` exists in the gRPC client.
 *
 * Transport is Effect's own `HttpClient` tag. There is no lower transport in
 * this repository, and there does not need to be one: the kernel already
 * decorates that tag with `net:get`/`net:post` capability checks, so a remote
 * artifact fetch is permission-checked like every other egress.
 *
 * ## Chunked uploads
 *
 * With `chunkBytes` set, a blob past that size travels as a sequence of
 * `PUT /cas/{digest}` requests carrying `Content-Range: bytes {a}-{b}/{total}`,
 * preceded by a `HEAD /cas/{digest}` existence probe and a
 * `Content-Range: bytes *\/{total}` probe with an empty body. This is the
 * resumable-upload shape HTTP already has: the range probe asks what prefix
 * the tier holds and `308` means "keep going", with a `Range: bytes=0-{last}`
 * header on the probe or on a chunk answer moving the offset.
 *
 * Only a `308` continues the sequence, and the completing chunk's `2xx` is
 * confirmed with `HEAD` before `put` reports the digest as published. A `2xx`
 * anywhere else, to the empty probe or to a chunk the tier is still owed bytes
 * after, reads as a tier that ignored `Content-Range` and stored the body it
 * was handed, which is what plain WebDAV `PUT` does. That tier, the one that
 * answers `400`, `411`, or `416`, and the one whose `HEAD` will not confirm
 * the stored length all get the same treatment: one whole-blob `PUT`, which
 * overwrites the partial body the sequence left behind. So the blob always
 * lands whole, and the cost of turning the dial on against a server that
 * never learned about it is round trips, never a digest published over bytes
 * the server does not hold.
 *
 * This repository's own hosted and self-hosted cache services are such
 * servers: neither implements the resumable sequence, and both refuse a
 * ranged `PUT` with `400`, RFC 9110 section 14.5's answer from a resource
 * that does not support partial `PUT`. Against them `chunkBytes` costs the
 * probe round trip and the blob travels whole, and both cap one request body
 * at 16 MiB, so a blob past that cap is refused with `413` in either mode.
 *
 * The endpoint and its credentials arrive as **layer construction options**.
 * They are capabilities, never step inputs: they are not hashed into a step
 * key, journaled, or returned in a recorded result. Invalid endpoint errors are
 * sanitized before they cross the boundary.
