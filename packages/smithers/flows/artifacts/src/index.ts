/**
 * The content-addressed artifact store: bytes addressed by their own digest.
 *
 * `ArtifactStore` is the byte half of the cache. `@smthrs/step-cache` maps a
 * step key to a recorded result, while large result bytes live here under their
 * digest. The package depends on `effect` and `@smthrs/crypto`, owns no SQL,
 * and bundles for the browser: host access is Effect's `FileSystem` and
 * `HttpClient` tags, both of which the capability kernel decorates in place.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { ArtifactStore, CombinedArtifacts, RemoteArtifacts } from "@smthrs/artifacts"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
 * import * as FileSystem from "effect/FileSystem"
 *
 * const layer = CombinedArtifacts.layer({
 *   local: Effect.map(FileSystem.FileSystem, (fs) => ArtifactStore.makeFileSystem(fs)),
 *   remote: RemoteArtifacts.make({ endpoint: "https://cache.example.com" })
 * })
 * ```
