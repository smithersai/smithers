/**
 * The content-addressed artifact store: bytes addressed by their own SHA-256
 * digest.
 *
 * It is deliberately *not* the step cache: the step cache maps a step key to a
 * recorded result, while large result bytes live here under their digest. The
 * two tiers remain separate because artifacts must be published before a cache
 * record may reference them. See the package README and
 * {@link https://smithers.sh/docs/concepts/content-addressing | step-key documentation}.
 *
 * This module defines the contract: the address schema, the service interface
 * and tag, and one layer per local implementation. The errors, byte helpers,
 * and implementations are defined in the modules named for them and re-exported
 * here unchanged, so this subpath and the root `ArtifactStore` namespace keep
 * their whole surface.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0-rc.0
