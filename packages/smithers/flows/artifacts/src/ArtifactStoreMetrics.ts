/**
 * Standard metric definitions for content-addressed artifact storage.
 *
 * This module only defines the metric handles, following the shape of Effect's
 * `ClusterMetrics`. No exporter ships in this package; provide one — for
 * example `@smthrs/observability` — and these counters appear in it.
 *
 * Only the local `ArtifactStore` implementations, filesystem and memory, update
 * them. `RemoteArtifacts` is deliberately uninstrumented, and the counters carry
 * no tier attribute, so read them as *local artifact store traffic* rather than
 * as artifact operations:
 *
 * - a `CombinedArtifacts` read the local tier serves counts one get;
 * - a read the shared tier serves counts NO get, because no local store
 *   answered it;
 * - the write-back that materializes such a read counts a put, indistinguishable
 *   from a producer publishing new bytes.
 *
 * Attributing operations per tier needs the tier in the metric, which would
 * change the published counter shape; until then this is what the numbers mean.
 *
 * The one shared-tier signal is {@link remoteFailure}: a `CombinedArtifacts`
 * upload or write-back that was refused, or abandoned at its deadline.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0-rc.0
