/**

 *
 * Reads are not digest-verified here, and that is not an oversight: the map is
 * keyed by the digest this store measured when it accepted the bytes, and both
 * boundaries copy — `put` stores a copy of the caller's array and `get` hands
 * out a copy of the stored one — so no reference a caller can still mutate
 * aliases the stored content, and there is no window in which the address and
 * the content can disagree. The filesystem and remote implementations verify
 * because their address spaces are genuinely shared.
