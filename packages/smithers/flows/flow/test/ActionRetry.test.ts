/**
 * `Action.retry` re-runs a block while keeping the durable identity of the
 * dispatches inside it: every attempt sees an incremented `CurrentAttempt`,
 * and each dispatch position keeps the ordinal it was allocated on the
 * attempt that first reached it. A nested block shares the enclosing block's
 * pinned ordinals and folds its own cursor positions back on exit.
