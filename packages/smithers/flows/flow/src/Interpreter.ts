/**
 * The body interpreter: what a flow does when it runs.
 *
 * A `Flow` has no handler to register — its `body` IS the behavior, per
 * `docs/concepts/flows-and-actions.md` — so something has to turn
 * the graph that body describes into execution. That is this
 * module. {@link layer} registers a flow with the runtime, and the
 * handler it installs builds the graph with {@link module:Graph.build} and
 * walks it: each node settles once, in dependency order, and the root's value
 * is the flow's result.
 *
 * What each variant does is the run-time half of what the AST recorded. An
 * `ActionCall` runs its declaration's implementation — looked up by tag in
 * {@link module:Implementations.Implementations} before the walk starts — as
 * the ordinary durable action `toLayer` built, so a node driven here takes
 * the same attempt journal, retry policy, and tier as the same action called
 * from a handler. Its invocation identity additionally folds this node's
 * structural address, keeping concurrent graph sites replay-stable. A `Map`
 * applies its deferred function to the real upstream value. A `Branch`
 * evaluates its digested predicate on the real
 * subject and settles ONLY the arm it took: the other arm is topology the plan
 * shows and the run skipped, and it is reported as such rather than silently
 * absent. An `All` joins its members by name, a `Succeed` yields its value, and
 * an inline `FlowCall` was already flattened by graph building, so it settles
 * with the body spliced beneath it. A `FlowCall` the author wrote as
 * `.child(payload)` is the one node that is NOT flattened: it opens a real child
 * execution under a deterministically derived id
 * ({@link childExecutionId}), which is what gives it its own journal lineage and
 * makes the parent's interruption and the child's suspension travel between
 * them.
 *
 * Planned references are resolved the way the plan names them: a payload
 * placeholder carries the `Ref` `{from, path}` its key material recorded, so
 * `result.files` reads `files` off the settled value of the node that produced
 * it.
 *
 * The walk is demand-driven from the root rather than a sweep over the node
 * list, because dependency order puts BOTH branch arms before the branch that
 * chooses between them, and executing an arm to discover it was not taken is
 * exactly what static topology exists to avoid.

/**
 * Registers a flow with the runtime, driven by its body.
 *
 * This is the only way a flow's behavior reaches the runtime, and the reason a
 * flow has no `toLayer`: a flow has one behavior and it is the body, so there
 * is no second, opaque one to attach. An Action is what carries an
 * implementation, and it attaches that implementation with its own `toLayer`.
 * Compose this beside the action implementation layers the body calls, over the
 * {@link module:Implementations.layerImplementations} table they file
 * themselves in — the table goes UNDER them, because filing happens while an
 * implementation layer is built:
 *
 * ```ts
 * Layer.mergeAll(Read.toLayer(read), Write.toLayer(write), Interpreter.layer(Pipeline)).pipe(
 *   Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations)
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * It accepts a flow whatever its requirement channel says, and requires only
 * the table. Registering a body is not running one: the handler installed here
 * resolves each call by tag when the run reaches it, which is the same thing a
 * driver does for a plan read back out of a journal. `Flow.execute` is where
 * the requirements are asked for.
 *
 * This low-level registration keeps the `process-local` callback policy for
 * compatibility. Select `callbackIdentity: "stable"`, or use
 * {@link layerWithImplementations}, to refuse unstable callbacks before
 * dispatch. Without that selection it makes no reproducible-plan guarantee.
