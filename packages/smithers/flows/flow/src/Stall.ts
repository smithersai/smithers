/**
 * The stall breaker: end a round loop that has stopped making progress.
 *
 * A round bound is only a budget. A loop whose rounds change nothing spends
 * the whole budget anyway: an agent that rewrites the same tree, a check that
 * fails the same way after every repair, a reviser that hands back the same
 * draft. This module counts consecutive rounds whose signal did not move and
 * reports a {@link Stalled} verdict once one signal has held for
 * `rounds` rounds in a row.
 *
 * Three signals are read, each optional per round:
 *
 * - `tree`: a fingerprint of the files the round left behind, such as a JJ
 *   tree id or a `TreeFingerprint` checksum.
 * - `checks`: the ids of the checks that failed. Order does not matter.
 * - `output`: the round's value, compared by the SHA-256 of its RFC 8785
 *   canonical JSON. A value with no canonical form is not compared.
 *
 * Everything here is data. The {@link State} a round carries forward is a
 * plain record, so a durable trampoline keeps it in its payload and a replay
 * reads the same verdict. The loop decides what `on` means: `stop` settles
 * with the stalled value, `park` settles for a person to resume, and
 * `escalate` fails.
