/**
 * The system wait point, as an ordinary declared action.
 *
 * `docs/concepts/flows-and-actions.md` names wait-for-event the
 * other half of the timer gap and says how to close it: ship it over the
 * existing `DurableDeferred`, so an external signal is a visible, keyed plan
 * node. That is this module. {@link action} is a plain `Action.make`
 * declaration — catalogable, `.call()`-able, one node in the built plan — and
 * {@link layer} is the implementation.
 *
 * Nothing about resolution is new. The wait is a `DurableDeferred`, so whoever
 * satisfies it completes it the way every other durable deferred is completed:
 * a token, and `DurableDeferred.succeed`, `fail`, `failCause`, or `done`.
 * {@link deferred} is how a resolver names the same wait point the action
 * awaits. The park is declared through the ordinary waiting vocabulary
 * ({@link module:WaitingAnnotation.annotateWaiting}) under `event`, carrying
 * that token as the compare-and-swap material a wake handler matches. Replay is
 * the deferred's: once a result is recorded, a re-driven round reads it and
 * runs through instead of parking again.

 * which is the same permanent park by a different route.

 * PAYLOAD, and the per-dispatch identity {@link module:Sleep} derives its clock
 * from is deliberately NOT applied here. A wait is a rendezvous with something
 * outside the run, and a resolver has to name the same wait point to complete
 * it, so the name is the author's and two calls naming one wait point await one
 * fact — which is the intended reading, not an aliasing bug. A sleep has no
