/**
 * Asking a person something, as an ordinary declared action.
 *
 * {@link module:WaitFor.action} is the general rendezvous: it parks until
 * something outside the run resolves it, and settles with whatever arrived.
 * That is the right primitive and the wrong affordance for a human, because a
 * human answers in prose, in a hurry, and sometimes wrongly. Smithers 0.x had
 * the affordance — a `HumanTask` with a kind, a prompt, an output schema, an
 * attempt budget, and a deadline — and this module is that affordance rebuilt
 * on the primitives this package already has.
 *
 * Four things are added to a bare wait:
 *
 * - a **kind**, so the four shapes a person is asked for (`ask`, `confirm`,
 *   `select`, `json`) are stated rather than reconstructed from a schema;
 * - **validation**, so an answer that does not fit is refused where it arrives
 *   instead of failing three steps later as a decode error;
 * - **re-asking**, so a refused answer parks again on a NEW wait point rather
 *   than ending the run, until the attempt budget is spent;
 * - a **deadline**, so a question nobody answers settles instead of parking
 *   forever.
 *
 * All four are built from what is already durable. Each attempt is its own wait
 * point in {@link module:WaitFor}'s namespace — `WaitFor/<name>#<attempt>` — so
 * an answer is recorded exactly as any other durable deferred completion is, a
 * refused answer stays recorded under the attempt that refused it, and a
 * re-driven round replays every answer it already has before parking on the
 * first attempt that has none. The reason an answer was refused is recorded
 * too, as a sealed step named `HumanTask/<name>#<attempt>/rejected`, so the
 * judgment the run made sits in the journal beside the answer it judged rather
 * than in a log stream nobody replays. The park is declared through the ordinary
 * waiting vocabulary under `approval`, carrying the current attempt's token, so
 * whoever collects answers always sees the one wait point that is open. The
 * deadline is a {@link module:DurableClock} armed once per task and raced
 * against every attempt, which makes it a deadline for the QUESTION rather than
 * for one attempt at answering it.

/**
 * Records one answer to a human task.
 *
 * `token` is the value the run parked with — the `token` of the waiting
 * annotation, which is the wait point the current attempt is open on. The
 * runtime checks that exact approval wait and records the completion as one
 * mutation, so guessed, unopened, or stale attempt tokens cannot pre-answer a
 * run. An admitted answer then resumes the run through the ordinary durable
 * deferred path.
 *
 * ```ts
 * yield* HumanTask.answer({ token: waiting.token, value: { decision: "ship" } })
 * ```
 *
 * The durable JSON boundary is validated here: the value must be inert,
 * detached, and within the exported depth, node, member, string, key, and byte
 * limits. Whether that JSON fits the question is the task's own judgment, made
 * where its kind and schema are known; a semantically refused answer stays
 * recorded so the record shows what was actually said. Call {@link validate}
 * first when the interface can refuse it while the person is still looking at
 * it.
 *
 * The TOKEN is checked. This entry point completes an arbitrary caller-supplied
 * address under `Schema.Json`, so it accepts only a token whose deferred name
 * {@link deferred} could have written. A token for a `DurableQueue` item, a
 * plain {@link module:WaitFor} gate, or an unrelated flow's deferred fails with
 * `TokenInvalid` carrying `deferred_mismatch` rather than writing a JSON exit
 * into a row another schema will decode.
 *
 * A syntactically valid HumanTask token can still fail with
 * `HumanAnswerInvalid` carrying `answer_not_open` when the addressed run is not
 * currently parked on that exact approval token.
