/**
 * What a driven graph tells its runtime about itself.
 *
 * The interpreter knows the whole plan before the first action runs, and it
 * knows when each node is scheduled and how each one settled. Nothing
 * downstream can derive those facts: an attempt record carries a step key and
 * no node id, so a monitor reading a journal can see the work and not the
 * graph it belongs to. These records are the missing half, and this module is
 * the only thing `@smthrs/flow` says about them — the port takes them, and an
 * engine with a journal is what turns them into durable records. A runtime
 * without one keeps its no-op and the interpreter is unchanged.
 *
 * Every record carries its own `sourceId`, and that is the replay-stability
 * contract: a resumed walk rebuilds the same graph and re-derives the same
 * ids, so a journal keyed by `(run, source, sequence)` collapses the second
 * observation onto the first row instead of recording the node twice.
