 * Use to read or update flow execution, suspension, interruption,
 * lifetime, failure, and action coordination state inside flow authoring
 * combinators and runtime implementations.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The service stores the execution ID, flow definition, long-lived scope,
 * suspension and interruption flags, the stored failure cause, and action
 * coordination state for a single flow run. `@smthrs/flow` declares the
 * contract; a runtime — `@smthrs/engine` — constructs the value.
