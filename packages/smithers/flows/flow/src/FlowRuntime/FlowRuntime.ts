/**
 * The execution contract flow authoring APIs are written against.
 *
 * `FlowRuntime` is the port: the smallest service a `Flow`, an `Action`, a
 * `DurableDeferred`, or a `DurableClock` needs in order to be executed,
 * polled, suspended, and resumed. `@smthrs/flow` declares it and depends on
 * nothing that implements it; `@smthrs/engine` supplies the implementation,
 * so the dependency runs one way only.
 *
 * Every method here takes a flow whatever its requirement channel says, and
 * demands none of it. The channel is a compile-time statement about which
 * action implementations a body names, and this port is below the place that
 * statement is settled: a runtime resolves each call by the tag the node
 * carries, which is the only thing left of a plan read back out of a journal.
 * `Flow.execute` — written against this port, one level up — is where the
 * requirements are collected, so the erasure is deliberate rather than a hole:
 * a caller reaching the port directly has already been asked, or is replaying a
 * persisted plan and has nothing to be asked about.
