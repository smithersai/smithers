/**

 *
 * This is a **typed failure**, never a defect: the caller is expected to be
 * able to recover from it (see `docs/troubleshooting.md`,
 * "FlowRuntime.FlowCycleDetected"). Detection itself lives in
 * `@smthrs/engine-store`'s `DurableEngineState.recordRunParent`, which
 * inserts the durable parent edge and walks the parent chain in O(depth)
 * inside one storage transaction, rolling back on a hit; the error is
 * declared here because it is part of the `execute` contract this package
 * owns.
