 * reason), `wakeAt` an absolute deadline, and `token` compare-and-swap
 * material a wake handler matches against.
 *
 * `request` is what the wait declares ABOUT itself, as JSON text, for a reader
 * rather than for a matcher: the question a `HumanTask` is parked on, its
 * kind, and its attempt budget. Nothing routes on it. It exists because `reason` and `token`
 * say only that a person owes the run an answer and which wait point holds it,
 * so an approvals inbox reading a parked run could name the gate and never
 * state the question — which is what left run-3's `coding-clarification`
 * unanswerable.
