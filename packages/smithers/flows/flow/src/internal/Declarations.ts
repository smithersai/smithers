 * Both literals exist so a CATALOG can project them from source text without
 * importing the module, so this is the only place either spelling is turned
 * into a value. A flow or an action that declares `capabilities` and one that
 * annotates {@link module:Flow/Annotations.Capabilities} are the same
 * declaration to {@link module:Graph.build}, and the same holds for `effects`
 * and {@link module:Flow/Annotations.EffectEnvelope}.
 *
 * It lives here, below both constructors, because a flow and an action lower
 * the same two literals and a second copy would let one gain a field the other
 * kept ignoring.
