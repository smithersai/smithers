 * a later operation causes the same round to fail or be interrupted.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The effect runs first. If it fails, no rollback is registered. If it
 * succeeds, its value is captured in a round-scope finalizer. The finalizer does
 * nothing when the round succeeds; when the round exits unsuccessfully
 * it calls `rollback(value, cause)`. Suspension keeps that scope open.
 *
 * A handoff completes the round successfully and discards its `withRollback` registrations.
 * A later round's failure cannot invoke those rollbacks. The engine does not
 * provide lineage-scoped compensation.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * This applies only to effects run directly inside the flow execution. It does
 * not attach rollback behavior to nested actions. The rollback's typed error
 * channel is `never`; handle expected rollback failures inside the callback.
