/**
 * Defines typed durable flow declarations.
 *
 * A `Flow` has a stable tag, schemas for payload, success, and failure, a
 * REQUIRED pure `body`, and an optional idempotency key used to derive
 * execution ids when the caller does not provide one. Flow definitions can be
 * executed, discarded, polled, interrupted, and resumed.
 *
 * The two nouns of `docs/concepts/flows-and-actions.md` divide the
 * surface here: an Action carries an implementation, attached separately as a
 * Layer; a Flow carries a body, and never opaque executable code. There is
 * therefore no handler to attach to a flow, and no `toLayer` on one to attach
 * it with.
