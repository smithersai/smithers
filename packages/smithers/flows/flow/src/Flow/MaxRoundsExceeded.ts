/**
 * A lineage asked for one more round than its flow's `maxRounds` allows.
 *
 * `docs/concepts/trampoline-rounds.md` chooses a budget over loop
 * detection: identical consecutive rounds are legal (a poller is exactly
 * that), so the only honest stop condition is a declared bound on how many
 * rounds one lineage may open. Exceeding it is terminal for the lineage — the
 * round that asked for the handoff is settled with this defect rather than
 * handed off — because a lineage that has run out of budget has nowhere left
 * to continue, and letting it keep going would make the bound advisory.
 *
 * `roundOrdinal` is the zero-based ordinal of the round that was refused, so
 * it always equals `maxRounds` when the refusal is raised.
