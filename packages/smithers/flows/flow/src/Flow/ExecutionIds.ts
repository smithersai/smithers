/**
 * The ambient source of execution identity, for a flow executed without one.
 *
 * Identity has three sources, in this order: the `executionId` the caller
 * named, the `idempotencyKey` the flow declared, and — when neither exists —
 * the source in this module. The first two are decisions an author made at the
 * call site or the declaration site; the third is a decision the *host* makes
 * once, for every flow it drives, which is why it is a context reference and
 * not another option on `execute`.
 *
 * The default mints a fresh cryptographic UUID for every unkeyed invocation.
 * Equal payloads are independent requests. To reattach after a crash, retain
 * the returned execution id, declare an idempotency key, or explicitly install
 * the `derived` source. Changing this default does not rewrite stored ids.
