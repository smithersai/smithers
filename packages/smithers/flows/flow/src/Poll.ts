/**
 * Polling as a durable lineage: one attempt per round, a durable wait between
 * attempts, and a bound the lineage settles on.
 *
 * Smithers 0.x had a `Poller` component — a check, an interval, a backoff, an
 * attempt bound, and what to do at that bound. The pieces it was built from
 * already exist here: {@link module:Sleep.action} is the durable wait, and
 * `Flow.to` opens the next round. What was missing is the shape that puts them
 * together, and that is this module.
 *
 * A poll is a flow whose body is ONE attempt. It runs the check, and branches:
 * a satisfied check settles the lineage with the check's own output, an
 * unsatisfied one sleeps for this attempt's delay and hands off to the next
 * round with the attempt counter raised. The last attempt has no sleep and no
 * handoff — it either answers with the output it just read (`return-last`) or
 * fails {@link PollExhausted} (`fail`).
 *
 * Everything durable about it is durable for the ordinary reason. Each attempt
 * is a round with its own keyed plan nodes, so a check that already ran replays
 * from its recorded outcome instead of running again; the wait between attempts
 * is a durable timer, so a process that dies during it resumes on the round it
 * left rather than starting the poll over; and the attempt counter travels in
 * the payload, so nothing about "which attempt is this" lives in memory.
 *
 * The bound is stated twice on purpose. The body ends the lineage on the last
 * attempt, and `maxAttempts` is also the flow's `maxRounds` budget, so a
 * lineage that somehow opened another round is refused by the engine rather
 * than polling forever.

/**
 * Declares a durable poller.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use it wherever a run has to keep asking until something is ready — a build
 * that finishes, a deployment that goes live, a review that lands — and the
 * waiting has to survive a restart. `check` is the one thing an author writes:
 * a body fragment that reads whatever it polls and reports a {@link Check}.
 * Everything else is schedule. Under stable callback admission (the default of
 * `Interpreter.layerWithImplementations`), wrap `check` in `Node.capture` with
 * every semantic capture, including a version for imported behavior. An
 * uncaptured check keeps the poll process-local. The helper captures its own
 * callbacks using the schedule and the check's identity.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const Deployment = Poll.make("deploy/wait", {
 *   input: { id: Schema.String },
 *   result: Schema.String,
 *   intervalMs: 5_000,
 *   backoff: "exponential",
 *   maxAttempts: 8,
 *   onTimeout: "fail",
 *   check: Node.capture(
 *     { action: Status.name, implementationVersion: "deploy/status-check/v1" },
 *     ({ attempt, id }) => Status.call({ attempt, id })
 *   )
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * The check may not fail. A check that can fail states what a failure means for
 * the poll — give up, or treat it as "not ready yet" — with `Node.catch` inside
 * the fragment, rather than leaving the poll to guess.
 *
 * A per-attempt time limit on the check itself is NOT a poll option. A plan
 * node's duration is not something the body around it can bound; that bound
 * belongs in the check's own implementation, where `DurableDeferred.raceAll`
 * races the work against a durable clock and stays replayable.
 *
 * A schedule no clock can be armed with is refused here, with a `RangeError`
 * naming the option that is wrong. `intervalMs` becomes the `millis` of a
 * {@link module:Sleep.action} node, and a wait of `Infinity`, `NaN`, or a
 * negative length arms a timer that never fires — a poll that hangs forever
 * with a plan that looks correct. The check is on the schedule, not only on the
 * interval: `{ intervalMs: 1000, maxAttempts: 2000, backoff: "exponential" }`
 * states three finite options and asks for an infinite wait, so the LAST wait
 * the poll can arm has to be a length too. `maxAttempts` is the lineage's round
 * budget, and a budget below one attempt reaches `Flow.make` as a `maxRounds`
 * complaint about an option the author never wrote.
 *
 * @throws A `RangeError` when `intervalMs` is not a duration a clock accepts,
 * when `maxAttempts` is not a whole number of attempts of at least one, or when
 * the interval under the declared backoff reaches a wait no clock can be armed
 * with before the budget is spent.
