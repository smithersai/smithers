/**
 * Graph building: a flow declaration plus a real payload, walked once into the
 * drafts a plan is compiled from.
 *
 * This is the plan phase of `docs/specs/Concepts/Build Phases.md` and nothing
 * else — no I/O, no execution, no elaboration. {@link build} evaluates the
 * body with the REAL payload, because a body's own payload is data
 * (`docs/specs/Concepts/Unified Flow Authoring.md`), and evaluates every
 * continuation and branch arm exactly once against a STRICT
 * {@link module:Planned.Planned} placeholder, because a step result does not
 * exist yet. A body that computes on a placeholder therefore fails here,
 * naming the node, rather than baking `NaN` into a plan.
 *
 * Fatal refusals stay fatal. Computing on a planned value throws its
 * `GraphBuildError` immediately, as does recursively expanding an inline
 * `.call()`, because either case makes the requested graph invalid. Recoverable
 * topology loss, such as a missing or invalid continuation, is reported in
 * {@link Graph.diagnostics} so the remaining graph can still be inspected.
 *
 * The walk is stack-safe by construction: topology and payloads are traversed
 * with explicit stacks, never native recursion, and each carries a nesting
 * bound. Topology past the bound is a typed `graph_too_deep` refusal, a
 * payload past it is `payload_too_deep`, and a payload containing itself is
 * `cyclic_payload` — all three fail loudly where unbounded recursion would
 * overflow the native stack without a typed error.
 *
 * Composition follows the same note: `Other.call(payload)` splices the
 * callee's body into this graph with the capabilities of the two declarations
 * intersected, and a flow that calls itself inline throws with the trampoline
 * (`docs/specs/Concepts/Trampoline Loops.md`) and the child boundary as the two
 * ways out. A callee whose declared placement the enclosing flow does not carry
 * throws for the same reason and names the same way out, because inline
 * expansion is the claim that these steps run in the caller's execution.
 * `Other.child(payload)` is that boundary: one leaf node here, its own
 * execution when the graph is driven. A branch expands BOTH arms, so the
 * exit condition and the handoff site are visible topology before anything
 * runs, and the predicate rides the branch's key material as a digest.
 *
 * What comes out is `@smthrs/plan` shaped: {@link Graph.drafts} feeds
 * `Plan.compile` and `Plan.append` unchanged, and the `Ref`/`Pending` inputs a
 * node's key material names are what the compiler turns into dependency
 * digests and the plan turns into edges. Structural node ids are derived only
 * from traversal positions and do not enter a plan draft's hashed value, so
 * editing a mapper re-keys exactly what reads it. The interpreter does use an
 * `ActionCall` id as durable dispatch-site material: it is the replay-stable
 * discriminator that keeps identical declarations at distinct graph
 * positions out of one arrival-ordered ordinal scope.
 *
 * Adapted from the agent repo's `@smthrs/core` `Graph.ts`. The lenient
 * placeholder, the model-shaped `Dynamic` node, the lane-merge elaboration,
 * and the conflict pass do not come across: the placeholder is strict here,
 * a model call is an ordinary action, and write overlap is resolved by
 * `Plan.compile`, which owns that verdict.

 * Whether an inline call would place the callee somewhere the enclosing flow

 *
 * A placement directive is opaque to this package — `Annotations.Placement` is
 * `Schema.Unknown`, and interpreting it is a scheduler's job — so the only
 * verdict available here is identity: the same directive is satisfiable, a
 * different one is not. The local comparison has the structural semantics of a
 * canonicalized literal without serializing it: arrays compare by length and
 * element, objects by their own enumerable keys independent of key order, and
 * primitives by `Object.is`. That makes `NaN` equal to itself and cheaply keeps
 * `-0` distinct from `0`. A visited-pair map terminates cyclic object graphs.
 *
 * Identity is claimed only over data the comparison can read inertly. Two
 * distinct objects are identical only when both are plain — an ordinary object
 * literal or a null-prototype object, or two arrays — and only through own data
 * properties: a `Date`, `Map`, `RegExp`, class instance, or function is
 * identical to itself by reference and to nothing else, and an accessor-backed
 * key is identical to nothing at all, because reading it would run author code
 * during graph building. Every one of those is a REFUSAL to prove identity, so
 * the call is pushed to an explicit `.child()` boundary rather than admitted
 * inline against a placement nobody checked. A `Proxy` over a plain object
 * still observes the key and descriptor reads; making the directive inert
 * before it is compared is the remaining half of that hardening.
 *
 * Identity over a CYCLIC directive is bisimulation: the visited-pair map makes
 * two directives identical when they unfold to the same infinite tree, so a
 * self-cycle and a two-node cycle of the same shape are the same directive.
 * Cycle lengths that share no factor pair off against each other for their
 * least common multiple of comparisons, which is what
 * {@link maxComparisonPairs} bounds.
 *
 * DECIDED: an enclosing flow that declares NO
 * placement is unconstrained and satisfies any callee, rather than satisfying
 * only a callee that declares none. Inline expansion runs the callee's steps in
 * the caller's execution, so the constraint that matters is the one the caller
 * already carries; refusing an undeclared caller would make `Flow.Placement`
 * mandatory on every flow in a call chain to keep `.call()` usable.
