/**
 * The system timer, as an ordinary declared action.
 *
 * `docs/concepts/flows-and-actions.md` names the timer primitive a
 * gap and says how to close it: ship it over the existing `DurableClock`, so a
 * wait is a visible, keyed plan node rather than a second execution mechanism.
 * That is this module. {@link action} is a plain `Action.make` declaration —
 * it appears in a catalog, `.call()` records a node, and `Graph.build` puts that
 * node in the plan beside every other step — and {@link layer} is the
 * implementation the hosts that can run a timer provide.
 *
 * The wait itself is `DurableClock`'s, not a new one. The implementation arms
 * the durable clock and awaits its deferred, which is what parks the execution;
 * the park is declared through the ordinary waiting vocabulary
 * ({@link module:WaitingAnnotation.annotateWaiting}) under `timer`, with the
 * deadline as `wakeAt`, so a durable driver records the same waiting row it
 * records for a hand-written `DurableClock.sleep`. Replay is the deferred's:
 * once the clock has fired, its result is persisted, so a re-driven round reads
 * it and runs straight through instead of parking a second time.
 *
 * Which clock a wait arms is the dispatch's own, read from
 * {@link module:Context.CurrentInvocationKey}: a keyed node already owns an
 * identity that survives replay and separates two identical calls, so the timer
 * inherits it rather than being addressed by the payload it was called with.
