 * invocations at a non-sealed tier (issue #130), so their ordinals, and with
 * them their step keys, attempt rows, and recorded outcomes, would be
 * assigned by fiber arrival order. A crash-resume that replays the fibers in
 * the opposite order would silently hand one invocation the other's recorded
 * outcome (issue #111); Temporal fails such replays with a nondeterminism
 * error, and the engine refuses the hazard up front instead of detecting it
 * after the corruption. Declare an `idempotencyKey` *distinguishing* the
 * invocations to dispatch them concurrently; a sealed action with a key
 * takes a pure cache key and is exempt.
