/**
 * The table a driver resolves a declared action's implementation through.
 *
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Unified Flow Authoring.md` splits an Action in two: a
 * declaration that is pure data and travels everywhere, and an implementation
 * attached separately as a layer, on the hosts that can run it. A body names
 * the declaration — `Increment.call({ path })` records a node and executes
 * nothing — so whatever later drives that node has to find the implementation
 * by name, from context, at execution time. That is this service: `toLayer`
 * files the implementation here when the table is present, and a driver asks
 * for it by the tag the node carries.
 *
 * "When the table is present" means present while the implementation layer
 * ITSELF is built, so ONE table goes under the implementations AND under
 * whatever drives them:
 *
 * ```ts
 * Layer.mergeAll(Read.toLayer(read), Write.toLayer(write), Interpreter.layer(Pipeline)).pipe(
 *   Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations)
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Filing is a build-time effect, not a declared output, so the type checker
 * cannot catch a composition that builds one table for the implementations and
 * a second for the driver. That composition files into the first and reads the
 * second, and the driver refuses the call at run time naming the action.
 *
 * The table is deliberately not part of `FlowRuntime`. The runtime port is what
 * a flow, an action, or a durable wait is EXECUTED against, and an
 * implementation table is not an execution capability: it is authoring data,
 * assembled by the same layers that assemble the declarations, and every
 * runtime implementation can serve one identically.
