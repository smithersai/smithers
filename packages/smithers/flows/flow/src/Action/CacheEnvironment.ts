 *
 * It is a *complete* value on purpose: an environment a composition cannot
 * fully describe is one whose cache hits cannot be justified, and the engine
 * executes rather than guessing at the missing part.

 * Declares a cache policy on an action.
 *
 * This is the form the engine honors today: `@smthrs/engine-store` reads
 * {@link CachePolicyAnnotation} off the dispatched action, bounds the age of
 * the row it may serve by `ttlMs`, and narrows the address that row is stored
 * under from `scope`. `@smthrs/patterns`' `WithCache` declares the same policy
 * over a `@smthrs/core` flow under the same annotation key, for the
 * declaration surface, so a policy written by either is read by the engine.
 *
 * The action is not mutated. `annotate` returns a new declaration carrying the
 * policy, which is what a plan captures.
 *
 * It is `@smthrs/plan`'s `CachePolicy.annotate` under this package's name for
 * it.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Action } from "@smthrs/flow"
 * import * as CacheEnvironment from "@smthrs/flow/CacheEnvironment"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
