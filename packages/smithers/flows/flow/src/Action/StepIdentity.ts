/**
 * Derives allocation scopes and run-local invocation keys.
 *
 * Ordinal step identity has four components: the kind of durable operation
 * (an action dispatch or an internal engine operation), the stable
 * declaration identity (the action name, or a fixed internal label), an
 * optional explicit idempotency component — a caller-declared string or
 * object — and an optional structural dispatch site. Every ordinal counter
 * in the engine is keyed by the scope this module derives, and the scope is
 * also folded into the persisted key as `parentScope`, so two dispatches with
 * distinct declarations or structural sites can never swap ordinals under a
 * permuted fiber interleaving (issues #73, #85, #98, #101).
 *
 * The derivation is injective: distinct `(kind, name, idempotency, site)`
 * inputs always produce distinct scopes. The name and site are
 * length-prefixed so their contents cannot splice across component
 * separators, and both idempotency forms are canonicalized to a fixed-width
 * digest under distinct tags so a string can never alias the object identity
 * whose digest it happens to spell.
 *
 * Governing contract: `docs/concepts/execution-identity.md`.

 * Injectivity: the name is length-prefixed (`<kind>/<length>:<name>`), so a
 * name containing `/s:` or `/c:` material cannot collide with a keyed form
 * of a shorter name, and the idempotency component is a fixed-shape tagged

 * `/g:<length>:<site>`; its length prefix prevents site contents from
 * aliasing another component or splicing across a future suffix. An absent
 * site appends nothing, preserving the prior encoding exactly.
 *
 * The object form is caller-owned material, so it can carry values canonical
 * serialization rejects (`Date`, `undefined`, class instances, `Redacted`);
 * the failure surfaces as the typed `SchemaError` (issue #151), never
 * as a thrown defect. The string and absent forms
