/**
 * The JavaScript runtime seam.
 *
 * A workspace declares which interpreter its tools run under and which version
 * it requires. This module is the service that answers for the host: it reports
 * the platform facts a fetch can vary by, measures the interpreter actually
 * installed, and refuses to proceed when the host does not satisfy the
 * declaration.
 *
 * It exists because the interpreter was previously an ambient fact. The
 * package-manager layer took a `platform` option and every target spelled `node`
 * into its own argv, so nothing in the system could say which interpreter
 * produced a result, and nothing could check that the interpreter on this
 * machine was the one the workspace asked for. Both are now one service that
 * anything needing an interpreter takes as a dependency.
 *
 * Host access is Effect's own: `effect/unstable/process/ChildProcessSpawner`
 * for the version probe. Platform facts arrive as layer construction options.
 * The live service defaults to the host environment when available and forwards
 * only executable-lookup variables. No Node imports are needed, so this module
 * stays browser-bundleable even though the interpreters it measures do not.
