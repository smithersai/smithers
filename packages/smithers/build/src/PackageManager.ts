/**
 * The package-manager seam.
 *
 * Installing dependencies has two distinct jobs.
 * Fetching populates a content-addressed store under `.flows/store`;
 * linking materializes one project's `node_modules` out of that store.
 * The first has stable identity from declared package-manager inputs, but the
 * current absolute-root implementation is deliberately not shared across
 * runs because it cannot freeze those files across a child-process open. The
 * second writes a local tree of hardlinks, symlinks, or copies, so it is never
 * restored from another machine either.
 *
 * This module is the `Layer` that decides which manager performs those two
 * jobs. It holds no flow vocabulary: `Install.ts` declares the actions and the
 * flow, and provides them over whichever implementation a composition picks.
 * Selecting Bun rather than pnpm is a layer swap, exactly as
 * `docs/specs/Specs/Object Model.md` requires of every host-facing service.
 *
 * Host access is Effect's own: `effect/unstable/process/ChildProcessSpawner`
 * for commands and `effect/FileSystem` for reads. The platform arrives as a
 * layer construction option rather than from `globalThis.process`, because
 * this module has to stay browser-bundleable even though the managers it
 * drives do not.
