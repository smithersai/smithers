description: "Dependency installation as a keyed flow: the measure, fetch, and link actions behind smithers build, plus the runtime and package-manager seams that hold a host to what a workspace declared."
---

`@smthrs/build` turns installing a project's dependencies into a build step you
can plan, key, and cache. It exports the `install` flow and the two seams that
flow runs against: the interpreter a workspace declared, and the package manager
that does the work.

This site is also the manual for **smithers build**, the Bazel-style build
orchestrator those pieces belong to. A workspace declares its packages and
targets in `PACKAGE.ts` files, a `WORKSPACE.ts` file declares the toolchain once,
and the `smithers-build` command plans and runs whatever a label selects.

## The problem it solves

In most build graphs, `pnpm install` is a hole. Nothing describes what it read,
nothing keys what it produced, and a build that depends on `node_modules`
depends on whatever the last person ran. `@smthrs/build` closes that hole with
three declared actions in one round:

1. **measure** records the content the install is keyed on: the lockfile digest
   and the credential-free `.npmrc` digest.
2. **fetch** populates the content-addressed store under `.flows/store/<manager>`
   from the lockfile alone, without writing `node_modules`.
3. **link** reconciles `node_modules` from that store, offline where the manager
   supports it.

The manager version and the host platform are not content. They come from the
`PackageManager` and `Runtime` services, which measure the host and fail when it
does not satisfy what the workspace declared. A declaration that nothing checks
is a comment.

## The shortest real example

Declare the toolchain once, in the workspace declaration:

```ts
// .smithers/WORKSPACE.ts
import { Smithers as S } from "@smthrs/targets"

const packageJson = S.file("//package.json")

export const runtime = S.Runtime.Node({ version: ">=26.4.0" })
export const packageManager = S.PackageManager.Pnpm({ version: "11.21.0", runtime })

export const Workspace = S.Workspace("demo", {
  repository: "git+https://example.invalid/demo.git",
  cache: S.Cache({ directory: ".flows" }),
  runtime,
  packageManager,
  nodeModules: S.Npm.NodeModules({ packageJson })
})
```

Then install:

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build install
```

That command plans the `install` flow under the declared manager's layer and
runs measure, fetch, and link. Only pnpm performs work today; a Bun declaration
resolves the service and refuses every operation with a typed `unsupported`
error rather than approximating a verified fetch.

## Where this package sits

Three packages make up smithers build, and each has its own documentation:

| Package                                                                                                   | What it holds                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@smthrs/build`                                                                                           | This package: the `install` flow, and the `PackageManager` and `Runtime` host seams.                                  |
| [`@smthrs/targets`](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/tree/main/packages/smithers/build/targets)     | The declaration surface `PACKAGE.ts` and `WORKSPACE.ts` files import: `S.Workspace`, `S.Package`, and target catalog. |
| [`@smthrs/build-cli`](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/tree/main/packages/smithers/build/build-cli) | The `smithers-build` binary: discovery, the planner, the executor, the caches, and the query and graph output.        |

All three sit under [`@smthrs/cli`](/api/cli), the `smthrs` command line and the
package everything in Smithers hangs off. That CLI runs durable flows:
`smthrs plan`, `smthrs run`, `smthrs ps`. The `install` flow this package
declares is one of those flows, built with the same `Flow.make` and executed by
the same engine, which is why an install has a content key at all. If you
arrived here from a search result and want the whole product rather than its
build system, start at [`@smthrs/cli`](/api/cli).
