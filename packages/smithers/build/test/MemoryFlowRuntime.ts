/**
 * The smallest `FlowRuntime` that can run `Install.Install` end to end.
 *
 * `@smthrs/build` depends on `@smthrs/flow` and not on `@smthrs/engine`, so
 * its suite has no `FlowEngine.layerMemory` to compose `Install.layer` over.
 * This fixture implements the three port operations the install flow reaches
 * (register, execute, actionExecute) and refuses the rest. Every action
 * outcome is recorded as the JSON-encoded exit `Action.executeEncoded`
 * produces, which is what a real engine journals: a value that cannot be
 * encoded dies here exactly as it would there.
 *
 * Modelled on `@smthrs/flow/test/MemoryFlowRuntime.ts`, minus suspension,
 * deferreds, clocks, replay, and ordinal pinning, none of which a one-round
 * flow with three sealed actions exercises.
