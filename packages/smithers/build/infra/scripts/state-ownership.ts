/**
 * Exclusive ownership of one Alchemy state directory.
 *
 * Alchemy writes deployment state while it runs, and redaction replaces the
 * files it wrote afterwards. Identity checks alone cannot fence the two: a
 * state file can be replaced between redaction's last check and the rename
 * that publishes its snapshot, and the newer state is lost. Every writer of
 * this state therefore takes ownership first. The deploy wrapper holds it from
 * before Alchemy starts until redaction has published its last file, and a
 * standalone redaction holds it across its own read, replacement, and
 * directory sync.
 *
 * Ownership holds an exclusive SQLite transaction for the entire operation.
 * Its stable database file must never be unlinked: the OS releases the lock
 * when a process exits. A PID file preserves diagnostics and fences older
 * deployment wrappers; stale PID reclamation runs under the SQLite lock.
 * Alchemy reads only `.json` entries there, so
 * the file is invisible to it. A lock whose owner is gone is reclaimed; one
 * whose owner is alive, or cannot be read, refuses the caller.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
