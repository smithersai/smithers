/**
 * The shared refusal gate every outward-effect rule runs before it acts.
 *
 * `S.Npm.Publish`, `S.Github.Pr`, `S.Github.Release`, `S.Github.Pages`,
 * `S.Git.Pr`, and `S.Changesets.Publish` all push bytes to somebody else's
 * machine. They share one contract, so they share one gate:
 *
 * - **Never cached.** An outward effect has no result to replay: the second
 *   invocation is a second publish. The rules opt out of the cache in the
 *   package executor and this module exists so the reason is written once.
 * - **Declared secrets.** Each rule names the credential it needs. A
 *   declaration that omits it is refused here, before anything is spawned.
 *   Only the declaration is read: a variable that is declared but carries no
 *   value on this host is refused later, at the transport boundary that
 *   resolves it, so no value is ever read here.
 * - **Approval.** `approval: "required"` refuses until a durable approval is
 *   granted. Package mode has no approval store, so the refusal is the
 *   honest answer there and the invocation has no side effect to undo.
 *
 * No rule has an outward transport yet. The package planner refuses each
 * one as not implemented, before this gate or any rule gate runs, so a
 * plannable outward target never spends a gate run on a certain failure.
