 * ({@link TargetStep}); nothing in the declaration is a command. Every argv the
 * rendered workflow carries is produced here or by the declaration it came from:
 * the install by {@link PackageManager.install}, the interpreter version by the
 * declared {@link Runtime}, the Rust install by {@link RustToolchain.install},
 * the target invocation by {@link PackageManager.exec} over the CLI verb.
 *
 * That is the whole point of the rewrite this module went through. A PACKAGE.ts
 * file that spells `run: "node --test scripts/pack-release.test.mjs"` has put a
 * gate outside the build graph: it is not planned, not keyed, not cached, not
 * addressable, and not runnable locally by the same name CI uses. Bazel's answer
 * is that every check is a test target and CI is `bazel test //...`; this module
 * is that answer for GitHub Actions.

/**
 * Generates the GitHub Actions CI workflow from PACKAGE.ts attrs.
 *
 * The workflow is a generated root file, on the same terms as `tsconfig.json`:
 * PACKAGE.ts is the only description of the pipeline, `write` renders it, and
 * `check` — the default — fails on drift. A pipeline that lives in two places,
 * a PACKAGE.ts declaration and a hand-maintained YAML file, is two descriptions
 * of one thing, free to disagree.
 *
 * Every step the workflow carries is derived, never authored. A job declares
 * what it requires and which targets it runs; {@link toolchainSteps} turns the
 * requirements into checkout, setup, and install steps, and
 * {@link stepCommand} turns each target step into one
 * `<manager> exec smthrs <verb> '<pattern>'` invocation. There is no attribute
 * anywhere in {@link Attrs} that accepts a command, an action reference, or a
 * shell script, so a gate that is not a target cannot be added to the pipeline
 * without first becoming one.
 *
 * The `lint` verb maps `write` to `check` through `attrsForKind`, so no lint
 * or `ci` run mutates a workflow file. Only `check` is cacheable; the output
 * file is a declared input there, so editing the workflow re-keys the target.
 *
 * Generated command example:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * - run: pnpm exec smthrs ci '//packages/...' --jobs 2
 * ```
