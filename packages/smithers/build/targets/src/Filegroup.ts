/**
 * Bazel-style file groups.
 *
 * A file group names a set of files under one label so other targets can
 * depend on the set instead of repeating its globs. It follows Bazel's
 * `filegroup`: `srcs` accepts declared files, declared globs, and other
 * targets, groups compose, and the group's contents are the deterministic,
 * deduplicated transitive union of everything it names.
 *
 * The target participates in no CLI verb. `kinds` is empty, so `smithers-build build`,
 * `test`, `lint`, and `docs` never select a group as a root; the CLI handles
 * that cleanly because {@link Target.Metadata} kinds are only consulted when the
 * planner filters roots, while dependency traversal, `query`, and `graph`
 * ignore them. A group reached as a dependency still executes, and executing
 * it is a successful no-op: {@link ExpandFilegroup} reads nothing but the
 * files the group names and returns them digested.
 *
 * ## Deviations from Bazel
 *
 * These are deliberate, and the general target when the two disagree is to
 * follow Bazel:
 *
 * - **No visibility.** Bazel gates every target behind `visibility`, and a
 *   `filegroup` is the usual way to publish files across package boundaries.
 *   smithers build has no visibility system yet, so every group is effectively
 *   public. When visibility lands, groups get it with every other target.
 * - **No `exports_files`, and `//`-anchored `file()` references stay legal.**
 *   In Bazel a package must export a file before another package may name it,
 *   and naming a file in another package without that export is an error.
 *   smithers build lets any target write `file("//path/to/file")` directly. A group
 *   is therefore a convenience for naming a set, not the only legal way to
 *   cross a package boundary.
 * - **A non-group target in `srcs` contributes no files.** Bazel takes such a
 *   target's default output group. smithers build has no output-file model yet, so a
 *   plain target in `srcs` is kept as an ordinary dependency edge — it is
 *   built before the group and its key reaches the group's key — but it adds
 *   nothing to the file list.
 *
 * Package-scoped globs, the other half of Bazel's file model, are implemented
 * in {@link Input.expandGlob} for every target, not only for groups.
