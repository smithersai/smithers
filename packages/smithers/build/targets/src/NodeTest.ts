/**
 * JavaScript test programs as declared targets.

 * `node scripts/browser-check.mjs`, `bun e2e/run.ts` — are all the same thing: a
 * program whose exit code is the verdict. Bazel spells that `nodejs_test`, and
 * this target is modelled on it. The deviation is the runner union below: Bazel
 * hands the entry point to a launcher and lets the program pick its own harness,
 * while this target names the three forms explicitly so the interpreter flag
 * never has to be written by a PACKAGE.ts author.
 *
 * The interpreter is the declared {@link Runtime}, never a hardcoded `node`, so
 * the same declaration runs under Bun by editing one line in the root PACKAGE.ts.
