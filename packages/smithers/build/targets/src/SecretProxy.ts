/**
 * Placeholder minting and outbound substitution for declared secrets.
 *
 * `Secret.ts` declares which environment variable holds a value. This module
 * is the execution half: it mints the placeholder a target actually receives,
 * and it replaces that placeholder with the real value on the way out.
 *
 * Four substitution seams exist, and they cover different things.
 *
 * 1. **Request-scoped.** {@link Vault.request} opens an exact-origin boundary.
 *    It resolves each authorized placeholder once while constructing that
 *    request and replaces an exact value echoed in the response.
 * 2. **Child request fields.** {@link startProxy} runs a local HTTP proxy a
 *    spawned tool is pointed at. Plain-HTTP request headers and bodies are
 *    rewritten. HTTPS `CONNECT` streams remain opaque because the boundary
 *    does not terminate TLS, so a tunnel to a declared audience is refused
 *    before any connection reaches it. Tunnels to other hosts pass through,
 *    since a placeholder is worthless anywhere but this proxy.
 * 3. **Secret destination URLs.** {@link Proxy.urlFor} gives a child a
 *    loopback capability URL. The proxy resolves the real HTTP or HTTPS URL
 *    only when the child calls that capability, then performs the outbound
 *    request itself. The true destination never enters child argv or env, and
 *    the boundary is seeded with the resolved URL, its origin, and its request
 *    target, so an upstream that echoes any of them back gets the capability
 *    URL rewritten over it before the child sees the response.
 * 4. **Brokered origins.** {@link Proxy.originFor} binds one loopback
 *    `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` origin per declared audience. The child sends
 *    plain HTTP there; the proxy forwards to the audience over TLS,
 *    substitutes the placeholders bound to it, and rewrites the audience
 *    origin in responses back to the loopback origin. This is how an HTTPS
 *    audience receives a header credential: `S.SecretOrigin(audience)` in an
 *    exec target's argv or env resolves to that origin at spawn time.
 *
 * The value is read from the host environment at substitution time and kept
 * only in the request-local boundary, never in the durable vault. A run that
 * plans without executing, or never reaches an authorized request, never
 * reads the variable at all.

 * Request paths, headers, and textual bodies are substituted only after the
 * exact destination origin is known. Upstream bodies are bounded and buffered
 * so exact resolved values can be replaced before the job sees the response.
 *
 * `CONNECT` is tunnelled unless its authority is a declared audience. A
 * placeholder that leaves through a tunnel to any other host is inert: it
 * resolves only through this loopback proxy, and only for its own audiences.
 * A tunnel to an audience is refused, because the placeholder would arrive
 * there encrypted and unresolved. Secret-bearing HTTPS requests use a
 * brokered origin from {@link Proxy.originFor}, or a brokered destination
 * from {@link Proxy.urlFor}; both perform the outbound TLS request here,
 * where substitution is possible.
