/**
 * Reading and rendering GitHub Actions workflow files.
 *
 * A generated CI pipeline is only worth anything if it still runs the gates
 * the repository requires. `GithubCiGen` used to render five hard-coded steps
 * whose whole pipeline was one `pnpm dlx @smthrs/build-cli ci //...` invocation, and it
 * declared `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as its output — so building the root
 * target replaced a multi-job pipeline (typecheck, lint, circular-dependency
 * guard, browser bundle gate, release pack smoke test, Rust fmt/clippy/test,
 * WASM reproducibility, Bun, macOS, Windows) with a single job that ran none
 * of them.
 *
 * This module supplies the two halves of the fix: a renderer that can express a
 * real multi-job pipeline rather than a fixed five-step one, and a workflow
 * reader, so the rendered pipeline can be checked against the gates the
 * repository declared before a single byte is written.
 *
 * The reader is two layers. YAML lexing and structure come from `yaml`, the
 * parser this package already depends on and already reads workspace data
 * with; a hand-written scanner used to do that job and carried its own
 * quoting, indentation, and block-scalar rules, which is where its bugs lived.
 * On top of it sits the part that is this module's own: a workflow validator
 * that refuses anything the gate contract cannot verify — a YAML alias or
 * merge key, an inherited `defaults:` shell, a duplicate top-level key, job
 * id, job field, or step field, a job with no runner or no steps, a step that
 * declares neither or both of `uses` and `run`. Failing closed is the point: a
 * gate this module could not see is reported missing, never assumed present.
