/**
 * The CLI verbs a generated pipeline may run across a target graph.
 *
 * A pipeline declaration names verbs, not target kinds: `smithers-build test '//...'`
 * is one command a CI job runs, the same verb-and-pattern shape Bazel's own CI
 * uses for `bazel test //...`. Before this module a PACKAGE.ts file named them
 * with bare strings, so the authoring surface was four quoted words whose
 * spelling nothing checked at the call site and whose meaning the attr name did
 * not explain.
 *
 * This module gives each verb a value. `Verb.Build`, `Verb.Test`, `Verb.Lint`,
 * `Verb.Docs`, and `Verb.Review` are declarations a PACKAGE.ts file
 * references by name, so a misspelling is an unresolved identifier rather than
 * a string the renderer rejects at plan time.
 *
 * The set is deliberately smaller than {@link Target.Kind}. `run` is
 * addressable from the CLI and is not here: run targets include development
 * servers and source-tree scaffolds, and an unattended pipeline must not start
 * or mutate one merely because it is addressable. A pipeline that runs `run`
 * targets is therefore not a declaration that exists, rather than one the
 * renderer refuses.
 *
 * `review` IS here, and it is not in {@link all}. A pipeline may declare a job
 * that runs the model reviews, and that job is the only thing that plans them:
 * the aggregate `ci` verb does not.
