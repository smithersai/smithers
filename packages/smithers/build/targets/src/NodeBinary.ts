/**
 * JavaScript build programs as declared targets.
 *
 * The build-verb counterpart of {@link NodeTest}: one program, run under the
 * declared {@link Runtime}, that produces files rather than a verdict. Bazel
 * spells this `nodejs_binary`. The deviation is that a target here declares no
 * output tree: these programs write through the package manager or a compiler,
 * outside anything the build system can digest as a hermetic output, so the
 * dependency edge to the program that consumes the result is the contract.
 *
 * The two types are separate because a target's participating verbs are fixed by
 * its type: the planner selects by kind, so one type covering both would put a
 * release-packing program in the graph of `smithers-build test`.
