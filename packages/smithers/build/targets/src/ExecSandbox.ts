/**
 * The one sandbox every tool run goes through.
 *
 * A target declares a policy (`Attr.Sandbox`): the default confinement, a
 * loopback opening, the full network opening, or the `"none"` opt-out. The
 * surfaces (`PackageExec` and `ExecLive`) turn the
 * policy plus the planner's read and write sets into a {@link Request}; this
 * module turns the request into an argv that the host enforces, or into an
 * {@link Unenforceable} refusal naming what the host lacks.
 *
 * Three mechanisms, one contract:
 *
 * - Linux: bubblewrap. An empty root contains only enumerated system/runtime
 *   paths and declared reads and writes. The workspace and root are remounted
 *   read-only after mounting grants. A private tmp supplies HOME. The network
 *   namespace is unshared unless explicitly opened; loopback-only is refused.
 * - macOS: seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`). Host reads are denied except enumerated
 *   system/runtime paths, declared inputs, external reads, writes and private
 *   tmp. Host credential locations are re-closed under broad grants. Writes
 *   and network access are denied except what the policy opens.
 * - Docker: `docker run` with a read-only root, declared reads mounted
 *   read-only at their host paths, declared writes read-write, `--network
 *   none` unless the policy opens it. The image supplies the toolchain. It is
 *   the path on Windows and on any host without the native mechanism.
 *
 * Every declared confinement is enforced or the target fails closed. Nothing
 * here logs "unenforced" and carries on. `S.Sandbox.Microsandbox` is not a
 * build mechanism: it names the runtime sandbox `@smthrs/sandbox` boots for
 * sessions, and a build target declared under it is refused with the
 * mechanisms that do confine builds.
