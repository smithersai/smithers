/**
 * The lockfile target.
 *
 * A lockfile is a generated file like any other: it is rendered from declared
 * inputs (the workspace manifests) and checked in. What is unusual is only who
 * renders it. The renderer is the package manager itself, because resolution
 * is the manager's job and no second resolver should exist. This target
 * therefore plans one manager command rather than a render function:
 * `--lockfile-only` resolves and writes without linking a tree.
 *
 * The {@link Install} target consumes the result. Depending on this target is
 * what orders regeneration before installation; the lockfile's content
 * reaches the install key through the install target's own declared inputs, so
 * a regenerated lockfile invalidates the install even though the same file is
 * this target's output.
