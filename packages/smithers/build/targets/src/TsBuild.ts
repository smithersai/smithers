 * variant because `PackageJson` derives a published package's `exports` from
 * the distribution layout for compiler and program builds. Tsup has no
 * declaration output and cannot supply automatic publish fields. The
 * derivation is the reason `format` is checked rather than trusted: it publishes
 * a `require` condition for every `dual` entry, so a target that declares `dual` and emits one half
 * ships a manifest whose CommonJS entry point does not exist.
 *
 * The check refuses `tsc` with `dual`. One `tsc -p` invocation emits one
 * module format, so the combination names a distribution no run of that tool
 * can produce. A package that publishes both formats declares
