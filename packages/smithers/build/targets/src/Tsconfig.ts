/**
 * Generated TypeScript configuration.
 *
 * A `tsconfig.json` decides what the compiler reads and what it emits, which
 * makes it part of the build definition. Leaving it hand-maintained next to a
 * PACKAGE.ts file that declares the same sources means two descriptions of one
 * thing, free to disagree. This target makes PACKAGE.ts the only description: the
 * file is rendered from attrs, and `check` mode fails when the checked-in copy
 * has drifted.
 *
 * Include and exclude take the file inputs a declaration already writes —
 * {@link Input.Glob} and {@link Input.File} — beside plain tsconfig patterns,
 * so one file set is spelled one way. Each entry renders to its pattern text:
 * a glob's pattern, a file's path, and a `//`-rooted path rewritten relative
 * to `cwd` the way `extends` is.
 *
 * The declarations stay out of the target's digested inputs, and the rule
 * resolves each one to its text before the target is constructed, which is
 * what keeps them out. A generator's output depends on the pattern text, not
 * on which files currently match it: keying this target on matched files would
 * make the config regenerate whenever any source file changed, while changing
 * nothing about the bytes it writes. A glob's own `exclude` list is dropped
 * for the same reason it is not key material — tsconfig has no per-pattern
 * exclusion, and the file's `exclude` section is the place to say it.
 *
 * A `Filegroup` target is not an include member. A group names files rather
 * than patterns: expanding one would put a build edge and a digested file set
 * on a target whose bytes are pattern text, and a group whose `srcs` name
 * another target would silently contribute nothing.
