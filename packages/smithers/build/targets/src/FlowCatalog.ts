/**
 * The flow catalog: discovered flows joined with their declarations.
 *
 * A repository's flows are discovered from `flows/` by the registry, and how
 * the repository presents them is declared in `.smithers/FACTORY.ts` with
 * {@link Flow.Flow} under the factory's `flows` key. Neither side alone is a
 * listing a reader can trust without running discovery: the Worker that
 * serves smithers.sh reads the public mirror and imports nothing, and a
 * workspace without `node_modules` cannot evaluate `FACTORY.ts`. The
 * `FactoryProjection` target (`Factory.ts`) projects both into the `flows`
 * rows of the checked-in `.smithers/factory.json`.
 *
 * This module is the pure half: the shape of a catalog row and the rules
 * that order the rows, testable without a filesystem. The discovery runs in
 * the executor, which hands {@link rows} the discovered flows.
