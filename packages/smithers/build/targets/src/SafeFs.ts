/**
 * Filesystem reads that hold the workspace trust boundary.
 *
 * Discovery reads files a workspace owns, and only files a workspace owns. A
 * path is a name, not an object: between the moment discovery decides a name
 * is admissible and the moment it reads through that name, the name can be
 * pointed at something else. This module reads through descriptors instead,
 * and re-checks every decision against the descriptor it actually holds.
 *
 * Three targets apply to everything here.
 *
 * 1. **Confinement.** A read is confined to a canonical workspace root. The
 *    directory holding the entry is resolved with `realpath` before the entry
 *    is touched, so a symbolic link anywhere in the path — including one
 *    swapped in above the entry — cannot move the read outside the root.
 * 2. **Regular files only.** A FIFO blocks the reader forever, a device is not
 *    repository content, and a directory is not a file. Each is refused rather
 *    than read. `O_NOFOLLOW` and `O_NONBLOCK` are added where the platform has
 *    them so the kernel refuses a link or a FIFO swapped in after the `lstat`,
 *    and `fstat` on the descriptor decides the question again regardless.
 * 3. **Only ENOENT means absent.** A permission error, a corrupt directory, or
 *    an unsupported entry type is reported. Converting one into "the file is
 *    not there" turns a broken workspace into a green one.
