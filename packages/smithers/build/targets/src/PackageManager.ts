/**
 * Declared package manager for PACKAGE.ts targets.
 *
 * A package-manager declaration names which manager a workspace installs and
 * runs tools with, the version it requires, and the runtime that manager runs
 * under. It is inert data: the constructors validate and perform no I/O, so
 * PACKAGE.ts evaluation stays pure.
 *
 * Before this module every target spelled `["pnpm", "exec", ...]` into its own
 * argv. That made the manager an undeclared constant of the target catalog: a
 * workspace on another manager could not use these targets at all, and no key
 * recorded which manager produced a result. A target now takes the declaration
 * as an attr and asks this module for the argv, so the manager is both
 * swappable and covered by key material.
 *
 * The declaration is discriminated by manager `name`. Classic variants retain
 * their reviewed version enumerations; tagged resolved variants also admit
 * requirements read from the workspace's declared manifest.
 * The Bun variant additionally types its `runtime` as the Bun runtime, so a Bun
 * manager declared against a Node runtime is not a value a PACKAGE.ts file can
 * write. The variant list is deliberately short — pnpm and Bun are what this
 * workspace pins and exercises — and it grows the same way the version lists
 * do: by review.
 *
 * The declaration carries tool identity only. It deliberately does not carry
 * the lockfile: the lockfile is produced by the `Lockfile` target and consumed
 * by the `Install` target, and a target cannot be keyed on a file it produces.
 * Targets that need the installed tree depend on the `Install` target instead,
 * whose own key covers the lockfile.
