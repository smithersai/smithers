/**
 * Measures one declared output, or fails with an {@link OutputError}.
 *
 * Every declared output is required, which is Bazel's target for an action that
 * does not create one: a missing path, an unreadable path, and a path that is
 * neither a plain file nor a directory each fail the target instead of
 * digesting as empty. An empty directory is a real result and digests to zero
 * files.
 *
 * `declared` resolves against `cwd`, which resolves against the workspace
 * root, and the result must stay inside the workspace both lexically and after
 * symbolic links resolve. Capture therefore cannot read or hash a target
 * outside the workspace, whether a declaration or a link planted during the
 * build points there. The declaration itself is re-checked here even though
 * target metadata already checked it, because this function is also reached from
 * an action payload and from a cache entry.
 *
 * The digest covers the sorted list of posix-relative paths and their content
 * digests, so an unchanged tree digests identically on every host and
 * regardless of directory order. File contents stream through one bounded
 * buffer, so an artifact of any size costs a fixed amount of heap; the tree's
 * metadata is what carries the explicit ceilings in {@link CaptureLimits}. Any
 * limit fails the whole output: capture never returns a truncated manifest.
 *
 * ## Boundary
 *
 * Node exposes no `openat`, no `O_PATH`, and no way to read a directory
 * through a descriptor already proven to be the right one, so a traversal
 * capability cannot be held across syscalls the way a `*at` API would let it
 * be. What is done instead is to observe an identity for every directory and
 * file when its parent lists it, and to re-check that identity, the entry
 * type, and the canonical workspace root at every later step: before a
 * directory's entries are read, after they are read, on the descriptor a file
 * is opened through, and again after that file has been read. A path replaced
 * inside any of those windows is refused, and the whole output fails rather
 * than publishing a manifest assembled from two different trees. The one
 * window that cannot be closed is between the last check and the syscall it
 * guards: `O_NOFOLLOW` and the descriptor's own `fstat` close it for the file
 * being hashed, and for an intermediate directory it stays open. This is not
 * race freedom, and no portable Node API can provide it.
