title: "Catalog rules"
description: "Every rule in the @smthrs/targets catalog, with the verbs it joins, whether its result may be replayed from the cache, whether it declares an output tree, and which route executes it."
---

Every rule this package declares, with the verbs it participates in, whether
its results may be replayed from the cache, whether it declares an output tree,
and which route executes it.

The route matters when you trace a failure. A `flow body` rule plans its own
work through the shared `Exec` action, so a Flow runtime alone can run it. A
`package executor` rule plans `Target.notImplemented` when explicitly lowered with `Target.plan` and is
dispatched natively by [`@smthrs/build-cli`](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/tree/main/packages/smithers/build/build-cli), so running one
under a bare Flow runtime fails loudly instead of doing nothing.

**Unsupported in this release candidate:** `Npm.Publish`, `Changesets.Publish`,
`Github.Release`, `Github.Pages`, `Git.Pr`, and `Github.Pr` have no outward
transport. The plan refuses each one as `not implemented by this executor`, so
`run` fails before any gate or effect. The plan also refuses `Npm.Downstream`
as `not implemented by this executor` because the isolated remote checkout
runner is not implemented.
Their declarations remain available for planning; they are not working release
or pull-request operations. Use an implemented publication tool or CI job.
