/**
 * Scoped supervisor for `S.Shell.Serve` services.
 *
 * A `services` edge means: acquire the Serve target, await bounded readiness,
 * keep probing its health while consumers run, scope it to them, and always
 * release it through the declared stop contract. This module owns that
 * lifecycle. The executor resolves a Serve target's attrs into a
 * {@link ServiceSpec} and calls {@link ServiceSupervisor.acquire} inside the
 * consumer's scope; the consumer's work runs under
 * {@link ServiceHandle.whileHealthy} so a service that dies or stops answering
 * fails the consumer with the tail of the captured server output instead of
 * hanging it.
 *
 * Lifetime is scope-based throughout (repo rule: no threaded `AbortSignal`s).
 * One supervisor is created per CLI command; services are reference-counted by
 * `key` through an `RcMap`, so two consumers of one Serve target share one
 * spawn and the process group is stopped when the last consumer's scope
 * closes — on success, on failure, and on interruption alike. A separate
 * process owner enforces that deadline after target exit and after the host
 * loses its private connection; raw numeric-PID backstops are unnecessary.
