/**
 * One plan invocation's host-probe cache.
 *
 * Every native planner (Docker, Foundry, Anvil, mise) needs host facts that
 * do not change between the targets of one plan: which executable a name
 * resolves to, what version it reports, whether a daemon answers. Without a
 * shared memo, N targets of one rule ran N copies of each probe subprocess
 * before a single cache lookup. This cache keys each fact by the executable
 * identity, the probe arguments, and a digest of the environment the probe
 * runs under, and stores the in-flight promise so concurrent targets share
 * one subprocess. Project-specific queries (`forge config` under one cwd,
 * config path, and profile) key on those facts too, so a project fact never
 * aliases a global one.
