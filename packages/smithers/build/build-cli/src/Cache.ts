/**
 * Opens the workspace cache.
 *
 * Local entries live under `<workspaceRoot>/<cacheDirectory>/cache` as JSON
 * files addressed by sanitized key and published atomically: an exclusively
 * created sibling temporary file is written, synced, and closed before it is
 * renamed onto the entry path, so a reader sees either no entry or the whole
 * entry. The cache directory must stay inside the workspace once symbolic
 * links resolve, checked when it is opened and again when an entry is written.
 * Every entry read from either store is bounded, type-checked, and must name
 * the requested key, so a truncated, oversize, forged, or misfiled entry is a
 * miss rather than another action's result. `cacheDirectory` is the
 * workspace-relative directory the CLI resolved and defaults to `.flows`. When
 * `endpoint` names an HTTP cache, the store also reads through its `/ac`
 * route: a local hit never touches the remote, a remote hit hydrates the local
 * file, and a put writes both sides.
