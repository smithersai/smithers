/**
 * Installs the process-wide module resolvers required by declaration evaluation.
 *
 * Targets, the planner, and the flow engine exchange values branded by Effect's
 * runtime symbols. A linked workspace can otherwise load another physical
 * `effect` installation—even at the same version—and hand the engine schemas
 * it cannot interpret. Declaration modules therefore resolve every `effect` bare
 * import from the CLI package that owns the runtime.
 *
 * The CLI also owns the declaration surface. Resolving
 * `@smthrs/targets` from here lets a globally installed `smithers-build` bootstrap a
 * repository before dependencies are installed; requiring it to install the
 * package would make generated package.json files circular to create.
 *
 * ## Hook order
 *
 * Two resolve hooks are registered, because the two jobs want opposite
 * positions in the chain. Node runs resolve hooks newest first, and tsx
 * registers a fresh namespace loader for every declaration module this CLI
 * evaluates.
 *
 * {@link parentHooks} pins a CLI-owned specifier, and has to run BEFORE tsx's
 * loader: tsx reads the namespace to apply from the `parentURL` it was handed
 * and stamps it onto whatever the rest of the chain returns, so a rewrite
 * performed underneath tsx changes the package the module is read from but not
 * the namespace it lands in. It is therefore re-registered after every tsx
 * registration; {@link importDeclarationModule} is what keeps that true.
 *
 * {@link formatHooks} pins a declaration module's format and identity, and has
 * to run AFTER tsx's loader, because both rules read what tsx resolved. It
 * stays where it was first registered and is never moved.
 *
 * ## Declaration module format
 *
 * The format hook below reports `format: "module"` for every declaration, so a
 * workspace whose nearest `package.json` declares no `type` still evaluates
 * its declaration as an ES module — but that override reaches tsx only when
 * these hooks were registered before tsx's loader was created. An evaluation
 * path that misses that window (a bootstrap that touches tsx first, or a
 * nested require from an already-CommonJS module) falls back to tsx's own
 * classification and evaluates it through the CommonJS bridge. Registering
 * tsx's public CommonJS loader once also covers nested, non-namespaced
 * requires. tsx owns TypeScript and file-URL handling; this package does not
 * patch Node's private CommonJS resolver. CommonJS callers must install their
 * dependencies where ordinary Node resolution can find them.
