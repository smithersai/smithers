/**
 * The known-red list: targets already failing on the trunk, named with an
 * owner and an expiry, so an execution fails only on a target that turned red
 * since.
 *
 * A trunk that has been red for weeks gives no signal: every run fails, so a
 * new regression looks exactly like the old ones. Requiring the whole graph
 * green before anything can land stalls every change behind the slowest fix.
 * The list is the middle: a failure it names is still executed and still
 * reported, but it does not fail the command; any other failure does. An entry
 * past its expiry names nothing, so the list cannot become a permanent mute.
 *
 * The file is JSON:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "entries": [
 *     {
 *       "label": "//packages/example:test",
 *       "platforms": ["win32"],
 *       "owner": "will",
 *       "reason": "path separators in snapshot names",
 *       "issue": "https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/issues/1",
 *       "expires": "2026-10-09"
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `platforms` is optional and matches `process.platform`; omitted, the entry
 * applies on every platform. `expires` is the last day, in UTC, the entry
 * holds.
