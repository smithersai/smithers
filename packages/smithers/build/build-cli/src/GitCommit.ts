/**
 * Executes one `Git.Commit` target: stage, gate, message, commit.
 *
 * The sequence is fixed. A change the invocation does not own refuses it
 * before anything is staged; the owned paths are then staged and the staged
 * index is written as one git tree, the candidate. The gates run through the
 * injected {@link GateRunner} against that tree, materialized over a scratch
 * copy, never against the live working tree: an unstaged or untracked file
 * outside the scope is not in the commit, so it can neither pass nor fail a
 * gate. A red gate refuses the commit with a typed error and creates nothing. The
 * message is the `-m` override when the invoker passed one, the declared fixed
 * text otherwise, or the injected {@link AgentMessage} composition when the
 * declaration names an agent. Only then is the commit created, and it must
 * record exactly the judged tree: an index that changed after the gates ran,
 * or a hook that restaged a path, refuses with `candidate_changed` and leaves
 * HEAD where it was.
 *
 * Both collaborators are interfaces because their real implementations are
 * integration concerns: the real GateRunner is the executor running gate
 * targets against a scratch copy holding the candidate tree, and the real AgentMessage is the
 * workspace agent stack. This module owns the ordering, the git plumbing,
 * and the typed refusals; tests drive it with fakes in a throwaway
 * repository.
