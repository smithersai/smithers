```text
smithers-build <command> [arguments] [options]
```

`makeCli` registers 24 commands, including the alias for `git-hooks` and grouped
`cache` and `show` surfaces. `normalizeArgv` adds another spelling: an argv
whose first token starts with `//` or `:` is rewritten to `target <label>`, so
`smithers-build //packages/api:lint` runs the bare-label form.

Option names are the kebab-case form of their schema key, so `cacheDir` is
`--cache-dir`. A boolean option that defaults to true is turned off with its
`--no-` form, so `--cache` becomes `--no-cache`.

## Workspace options

Every command except `create-app` takes these.

| Option        | Alias | Type   | Default                | Meaning                                                         |
| ------------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--workspace` | `-w`  | string | the working directory  | A directory inside the workspace. Discovery walks up from it.   |
| `--cache-dir` |       | string | the declared directory | Workspace-relative cache directory, overriding the declaration. |

`--cache-dir` must be relative, non-empty, and free of `..` segments; anything
else fails the command. Precedence is the flag, then the `S.Cache({ directory })`
in the workspace declaration, then `.flows`. See
[Caching](./concepts/caching.md).

## Execution options

`affected`, `clean`, `watch`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `docs`, `review`, `run`,
`target`, and `ci` add these to the workspace options.

| Option                   | Alias | Type       | Default          | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--plan`                 |       | boolean    | `false`          | Print the plan and skip target bodies.                            |
| `--verbose`              |       | boolean    | `false`          | Show plain progress for agents and pipe consumers.                |
| `--jobs`                 | `-j`  | integer 1+ | host parallelism | Maximum concurrent targets.                                       |
| `--include-exclusive`    |       | boolean    | `false`          | Include exclusive targets in wildcard `ci` and `test` selections. |
| `--cache` / `--no-cache` |       | boolean    | `true`           | Consult the cache before running. `--no-cache` still publishes.   |

Exclusive targets run alone after ready ordinary work drains, regardless of
`--jobs`. Dependencies keep their ordering. Explicit labels, including
`//packages/...:faults`, select exclusive targets without an opt-in flag.
`--plan` applies the same selection rules and skips target bodies. It still
evaluates trusted declarations, reads the workspace, and may run tool probes
or resolve and build declared environments. See
[Planning requirements](./guides/inspect-a-workspace.md#see-what-a-run-would-do)
for required tools and possible host and cache writes.

## Global options

`--audience <auto|human|agent>` selects the consumer experience; `auto` detects
verified harness markers and terminal capabilities. `SMITHERS_AUDIENCE` supplies
the environment override. Humans receive progress eagerly; agents receive
concise Incur results and useful next commands, with progress silent by default.

`--silent` suppresses progress, not results or failures. The public CLI retains
`--quiet` on commands that previously supported it; it is not a global target
option. Execution commands accept `--verbose` to enable plain progress for agents.
`--ui <auto|tty|stream|plain>` chooses the target-progress style within the
audience policy: it does not override silence or alter result encoding.
See [Output and renderers](./concepts/output.md).

The CLI is built on [incur](https://github.com/wevm/incur), which supplies the
rest on every command: `--help`, `--version`, `--json`,
`--format <toon|json|yaml|md|jsonl>`, `--filter-output`, `--full-output`,
`--schema`, `--llms`, and the `--token-count`, `--token-limit`, and
`--token-offset` trio. Output is TOON by default. Run
`smithers-build <command> --help` for the list a given version serves.

## Execution commands

Each of these takes a pattern argument, the workspace options, and the
execution options.

| Command  | Argument    | Own options                                                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`  | `<pattern>` |                                                               |
| `test`   | `<pattern>` |                                                               |
| `lint`   | `<pattern>` | `--fix`                                                       |
| `docs`   | `<pattern>` | `--write`                                                     |
| `review` | `<pattern>` |                                                               |
| `ci`     | `<pattern>` |                                                               |
| `run`    | `<pattern>` | `--name, -n`, `--message, -m`, `--sweep`, `--input, -i`       |
| `target` | `<label>`   | `--write`, `--fix`, `--message, -m`, `--sweep`, `--input, -i` |

### build, test, lint

Execute the targets a pattern selects under that kind. A target participates
in a verb when its rule declares that kind, so `lint` over a package selects
its linters and its drift checks and nothing else. A verb that cannot execute
a selected target reports the unsupported rule rather than returning a false
green.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build test '//packages/...'
pnpm exec smithers-build lint '//packages/api:lint'
```

`--fix` lets an agent lint target write inside its declared `fixes` write set.
Without it the target checks and reports.

### docs

Executes documentation parity checks, `Docs.Check` freshness checks, and
`Docs.Page` writers selected by the pattern.

`Docs.Page` runs the declared model CLI and needs its executable and
credentials on the host. It writes the declared output page after its gates
accept the candidate, without `--write`. An explicit `docs` invocation,
including a wildcard pattern, can therefore invoke a model and rewrite pages.
Use `--plan` to inspect the selection without executing it.

`Docs.Check` checks page and input freshness against a recorded stamp without
invoking a model. `docs --write` refreshes the selected `Docs.Check` stamps
from the existing pages and current inputs; it does not regenerate those pages.
A missing page must be generated before it can be stamped. This flag does not
control `Docs.Page` writes. `ci` excludes attended `Docs.Page` writers from its
selection and checks freshness without refreshing stamps.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build docs '//:page'
pnpm exec smithers-build docs '//:pageCheck'
pnpm exec smithers-build docs '//:pageCheck' --write
```

### review

Executes the model-review targets a pattern selects. A review expands a git
diff against a base revision at plan time and then spawns a model CLI, so it
participates in this verb alone.

A target whose engine executable is not installed on the host is reported
skipped, under its own glyph, with a notice naming the executable. A skip
leaves the run green because `ok` counts failures alone, and nothing claims
the review passed. That is the honest report: a machine with no `codex` on
`PATH` cannot say whether the change is clean.

### ci

Plans `lint`, `build`, `test`, and `docs` over one merged graph and executes
it once, so a target two verbs select runs a single time.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build ci '//packages/...'
```

Plans merge in that order. Views with the same label and `keyPreview` are
deduplicated. When keys differ, the lint view takes priority regardless of
plan order; conflicting non-lint views are rejected. A generator selected by
both `build` and `lint` therefore uses its non-mutating lint form.

The merge retains planned services and key-only dependencies for lookup.
Services are acquired by their consumers after readiness succeeds and released
when those consumers finish; they are not scheduled as ordinary CI targets.
The same rule applies to `affected ci` selections.

`review` and `run` are absent for the same reason. Planning a review on a
shallow pull-request checkout kills the aggregate before any target runs, and
executing one needs a binary and a credential no hosted runner has. `run`
mutates the tree, which is a decision, not a check. Ask for either by name.

If a verb has no targets under the pattern, `ci` continues with the rest. If
none of the four has any, the command fails with the first refusal.

### run

Executes run targets: generators in their writing form, publishes, agent
tasks, and commits.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build run '//:changelog'
pnpm exec smithers-build run '//packages/api:publish'
```

`--name` supplies a package name to scaffold targets. The three invocation
flags below apply here and to `target`.

### target

Executes one label under the verb its rule flavour implies, and is what a bare
label resolves to:

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build target '//packages/api:lint'
pnpm exec smithers-build '//packages/api:lint'
```

It is the one way to run a `review` target without naming the verb, and the
one way to reach a target whose kind you would otherwise have to remember.

`--write` applies `Diff`, `Generate`, and `CiGen` targets instead of checking
them for drift.

### The invocation flags

`run` and `target` take three flags that change what an outward or agent
target does.

- `--message, -m <text>` overrides the declared commit message of a
  `Git.Commit` target.
- `--sweep` lets a `Git.Commit` target with no declared path scope commit the
  whole working tree. Without it, such a target refuses with
  `unrelated_changes` and names the paths the commit does not own.
- `--input, -i name=value` is repeatable and becomes an agent target's
  payload. A value without `=`, or a name repeated, fails the command.

## Workspace commands

These take the workspace options and execute no targets.

| Command     | Argument    | Own options     |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| `install`   |             |                 |
| `query`     | `<expr>`    |                 |
| `index`     | `<pattern>` |                 |
| `graph`     | `<pattern>` | `--mermaid, -m` |
| `owners`    | `[paths…]`  | `--diff, -d`    |
| `git-hooks` |             | `--write`       |

### install

Plans and executes the install flow the root `PACKAGE.ts` declares, under the
runtime and package manager the workspace declaration names. It takes no
label.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build install
pnpm exec smithers-build install --workspace /path/to/checkout
```

The root package must declare exactly one `Install` target. Zero or more than
one fails the command before anything runs.

### query

Lists labels, or evaluates one of three functions.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build query '//packages/...'
pnpm exec smithers-build query 'deps(//packages/api:lib)'
pnpm exec smithers-build query 'rdeps(//packages/api:lib)'
pnpm exec smithers-build query 'owners(//packages/api:lib)'
```

A label or pattern lists each selected target with its rule, its kinds, and
the one-line summary its declaration carries. `deps(<label>)` prints the
transitive closure below a target with its edges, `rdeps(<label>)` prints
every target that depends on it, and `owners(<label>)` prints the owners,
their roles and reasons, the package's agent policy, and its upstream
packages. All three functions need a single exact or default target and refuse
a pattern that resolves to several.

A `Repo.Target` row that a child workspace could not answer for carries a
`refusal`, rendered for a person and carried in the envelope.

### index

Lists every target a pattern selects as its declaration states it.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build index '//...'
pnpm exec smithers-build index '//packages/api/...' --format json
```

Each row carries the label, the declaring package and target name, the rule,
the kinds, the summary and featured flag, the generator mode when the rule
declares one, whether the target is cacheable, the declared inputs as `kind`
records (`file`, `glob`, `pnpm-workspace`, `git-diff`) with their paths
resolved from the declaring package, the workspace-relative paths the
target writes, its labeled dependencies, and the PACKAGE.ts that declared it.
A row carries no cache key, no content digest, no line number, and no host
fact, so the same declarations index the same way on every machine. For a
person the listing is aligned `LABEL`, `RULE`, and `KINDS` columns with the
outputs after an arrow and a star on a featured row. The root `//:targetIndex`
target (`Smithers.TargetIndex`) commits the same rows as
`.smithers/target-index.json`: `target //:targetIndex --write` writes the
file and `lint '//:targetIndex'` fails on drift.

### graph

Prints the target graph a pattern selects without executing it.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build graph '//packages/...'
pnpm exec smithers-build graph '//packages/...' --mermaid > graph.mmd
```

`--mermaid` renders a Mermaid flowchart instead of a text tree. Mermaid is
meant for a file or a renderer, so that form is always returned as data and
never drawn to the terminal.

### owners

Resolves owners, reasons, and the agent policy for workspace paths, or for
every path a diff touches.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build owners packages/api/src/server.ts
pnpm exec smithers-build owners --diff main
```

`--diff <base>` adds every path changed since that git base, the same set
`S.gitDiff(base)` expands. The command needs at least one path, from the
argument list or from `--diff`.

### git-hooks

`gitHooks` remains an alias for `git-hooks`.

Renders the hook scripts the workspace declaration binds and compares them
byte for byte against the directory returned by `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`.
This supports linked worktrees and relative or absolute `core.hooksPath` settings.
If Git is unavailable, the command falls back to `.git/hooks` under the workspace
root; that fallback requires a `.git` directory.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build git-hooks
pnpm exec smithers-build git-hooks --write
```

Drift is a red exit that names each drifting file and its status, like every
other generated file. `--write` installs the rendered scripts and reports what
it wrote.

## Inspection and maintenance

These commands inspect the workspace or operate on explicitly bounded local
state.

| Command          | Arguments          | Own options                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `cache status`   |                    |                                           |
| `cache prune`    |                    | `--older-than-days`, `--dry-run`, `--yes` |
| `cache clear`    |                    | `--dry-run`, `--yes`                      |
| `show target`    | `<label>`          | `--verb`                                  |
| `show workspace` |                    |                                           |
| `targets`        | `[pattern]`        |                                           |
| `info`           |                    |                                           |
| `explain`        | `<label>`          | `--verb`                                  |
| `affected`       | `<verb> [pattern]` | `--base`, `--head`, `--files`, `--list`   |
| `clean`          | `[pattern]`        |                                           |
| `watch`          | `<verb> [pattern]` | `--debounce-ms`, `--once`                 |

`cache status` reports the local action-result count and size plus the remote
endpoint without exposing credentials. `cache prune` selects entries older
than 30 days by default; `cache clear` selects all entries. Deletion requires
`--yes`, while `--dry-run` writes nothing. Only individual local action-result
files are removed; durable runs, artifacts, stores, and directories remain.
Deletion is irreversible and fails closed if a path changes mid-operation.

`show target` reports the rule, kinds, dependencies, owners, inputs, outputs,
planned key, and local cache state for one target. `explain` returns the same
report. `show workspace` and `info` report resolved workspace and host
configuration. These commands do not execute targets or probe the remote
cache. `targets` lists the available target surface and defaults to `//...`.

`affected` accepts `build`, `test`, `lint`, `docs`, `review`, `run`, or `ci`.
It compares `--base` (default `HEAD`) with `--head`, or with the working tree
and untracked files when `--head` is absent. Repeatable `--files` bypasses Git
discovery, and `--list` explains the selection without executing it. Unknown
or ambient inputs conservatively select the graph.

Each Git invocation has a 60-second deadline and a 16 MiB limit on each output
stream. Cancellation interrupts discovery as well as target execution. A Git
timeout, invalid output, or nonzero exit fails `affected`; it never becomes an
empty changed-file list. Embedded callers can pass `signal` and `timeoutMs`
to `Affected.changedPaths` and inspect its typed `AffectedGitError`.

`clean` executes only declared `Clean` targets and refuses an empty selection.
`watch` runs the selected verb in fresh child processes, cancels stale work,
and replans after a change. It ignores `.git`, `node_modules`, cache state, and
declared outputs. `--debounce-ms` defaults to 200 with a minimum of 20;
`--once` performs one cycle. Watch is deliberately unavailable through MCP.

On POSIX, stopping a cycle sends SIGTERM to its process group, escalates to
SIGKILL after five seconds if any member survives, and waits for the group to
disappear before reporting completion or starting a replacement. A leader that
exits early does not cancel escalation. If the group remains five seconds after
SIGKILL or signalling fails, watch reports a cleanup failure and stops. This
also cleans up descendants left by a completed cycle. These command-scoped
processes have no durable flow host identity or process journal; recovery after
the watch parent itself is killed is outside this contract. Windows uses the
Node spawner's process-tree termination and does not provide the POSIX group
absence check.

## Scaffolding

### create-app

Scaffolds a Smithers app from a `@smthrs/create-app` template. It takes
neither `--workspace` nor `--cache-dir`, because it creates a directory rather
than reading a workspace.

```bash
pnpm exec smithers-build create-app my-app
```

| Option       | Alias | Type   | Default   | Meaning       |
| ------------ | ----- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `--template` | `-t`  | string | `default` | Template name |

The directory's own name becomes the app name, so it must match
`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`. The directory must not exist or must be empty. See
[Scaffold an app](./guides/scaffold-an-app.md).

## Exit codes

The CLI exits `0` or `1`. There is no third code.

| Code | When                                                                                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | The command completed: every executed target settled green, or the command only read the workspace. |
| `1`  | A target failed, a command refused, argument parsing failed, or a signal interrupted the run.       |

A red run exits 1 whether the failure is reported as a structured error on
standard output or as rendered text on standard error. When a human renderer
has already explained what failed, only the exit code remains to record, so
the envelope's error block is not printed twice.

`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` abort every running target and set the exit code to 1,
whatever the command was about to report. The second interrupt stops the
process at once. See [The invocation pipeline](./concepts/invocation.md).

## Error codes

A structured failure carries a code alongside its message.

| Code                                                                                                                     | Meaning                                                            |

| `git_hooks_failed`                                                                                                       | Rendering or installing the hooks failed.                          |

| `SMTHRS_UI`                             | The renderer, when `--ui` is `auto`.                                                |
| `SMTHRS_SHARD`                          | `<index>/<total>` selecting one shard of a sharded target.                          |
| `SMTHRS_AGENT_FAKE`                     | A script file that replaces the real agent CLI, for deterministic tests.            |
| `SMTHRS_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS`               | The agent session timeout.                                                          |
| `SMTHRS_DEBUG_KEYS`                     | A file every node's key material is appended to, for cache-key forensics.           |
| `NO_COLOR`, `TERM`, `CI`, `FORCE_COLOR` | Renderer selection under `--ui auto`.                                               |

`SMITHERS_CACHE_URL` and `SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN` are read once by the process
entry point and deleted from the environment before any declaration module
evaluates, so no workspace file can read them. Both names, and every name a
workspace marks sensitive, are also stripped from the environment of every
spawned tool, in both phases. Planning strips them once, before it captures the
host environment, so the tools it consults over workspace-controlled input
never see them either: `forge config`, `go version`, `go env`, `go list`, `nix
develop`, `docker info`, `docker buildx ls`, and each declared executable's
version probe. Execution also withholds these names from `Git.Commit` git
commands and hooks, and from both `Memory.Retain` ref resolution and the
`smithers memory` subprocess.

Git commit commands and both memory subprocesses have a 60-second deadline.
Plan-time `go list` has a 60-second deadline; fallback `nix develop` tool
resolution has a five-minute deadline. Each receives the run's abort signal.
Git commands disable terminal credential prompts and interactive editors.

## Runtime

The package requires Node 22.19+ (Node 22) or 24.11+. `src/main.js` installs the Effect
module resolution hook and boots the programmatic `tsx` loader that ships as a
CLI dependency, which then loads the CLI's own modules and the workspace's
`WORKSPACE.ts` and `PACKAGE.ts` declarations. See
[Installation](./installation.md).
