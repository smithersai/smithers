## Availability

`@smthrs/mcp` is not published to npm yet. Its source is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers), and the `smthrs` command line
is the worked example of everything on this page: it composes this package
behind `--mcp-config`.

When it publishes, the install is one command:

```bash
pnpm add @smthrs/mcp@next
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.19+ (Node 22) or 24.11+.
- [`effect`](https://effect.website) 4.0.0-rc.112, a peer dependency and the
  version this package is built against. Connection and tool-call operations
  return an `Effect`, and every schema is an `effect/Schema`. `McpFlows.mcp`
  is synchronous and returns a `FlowBinding.Source`; `Diagnostics.layer` is a
  `Layer` constructor.

The package ships as both ESM and CommonJS with TypeScript declarations. The
`@smthrs/*` packages the adapter composes are ordinary dependencies and install
with it.

## Provide a process spawner

Every constructor that opens a connection requires two services from the
caller's environment:

| Requirement           | Why                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ChildProcessSpawner` | An MCP server is a subprocess. The spawner is Effect's process port, not a Node import. |
| `Scope`               | The connection is scoped. Closing the scope tears the server process down.              |

On Node, `@effect/platform-node` provides the spawner:

```bash
pnpm add @effect/platform-node@4.0.0-rc.112
```

```ts
import { NodeServices } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const runnable = Effect.provide(Effect.scoped(program), NodeServices.layer)
```

These are the same services a host already provides for
`StandardFlows.shell`, so a composition that runs shell commands already has
them.

## Import forms

The root entry point re-exports every module as a namespace:

```ts
import { McpClient, McpError, McpFlows } from "@smthrs/mcp"
```

Each module is also importable from its own subpath, which is the form the
[API reference](./api.md) uses in its examples:

```ts
import * as McpClient from "@smthrs/mcp/McpClient"
import * as McpFlows from "@smthrs/mcp/McpFlows"
```

`McpError` is a namespace either way. The error class is `McpError.McpError`:

```ts
import * as McpError from "@smthrs/mcp/McpError"

const failure = new McpError.McpError({ code: "timeout", message: "...", server: "github" })
```

Two subpath forms are not public: `@smthrs/mcp/internal/*` and
`@smthrs/mcp/*/index`. Both are blocked in the package's export map, so the
JSON-RPC codec and the stdio transport are not importable.
`@smthrs/mcp/package.json` is exported.

## What a host composition adds

The projected `FlowBinding.Source` is only useful to something that composes a
flow catalog. [`@smthrs/harness`](/api/harness),
[`@smthrs/capability`](/api/capability), and [`@smthrs/core`](/api/core)
are runtime dependencies of this package and install with it:

- `@smthrs/harness` owns `FlowBinding`, the contract this package implements.
  `FlowBinding.catalog` merges this source with the others a host offers. See
  [Bind flows](/pkg/harness/guides/bind-flows).
- `@smthrs/capability` owns the action vocabulary `McpFlows.capabilities` is
  derived from.

What a host adds is the thing that runs the cell loop:

The runtime `@smthrs/*` dependencies of this package are `@smthrs/canonical`,
`@smthrs/capability`, `@smthrs/core`, `@smthrs/harness`, `@smthrs/journal`,
and `@smthrs/kernel`. `@smthrs/registry` and `@smthrs/model` are development
dependencies only. A host that imports any of them directly declares it in its
own manifest.

```bash
pnpm add @smthrs/agent@next
```

[`@smthrs/agent`](/api/agent) takes the projected sources as its `flows` option,
alongside `StandardFlows.filesystem` and the rest.

The CLI already wires all of this. `smthrs --mcp-config <path>` connects every
server the file names and adds its flows to a run's catalog; see
[Configure servers for the CLI](./guides/configure-servers-for-the-cli.md).

## Next step

Connect to a real server and call one of its tools in the
[Quickstart](./quickstart.md).
