/**
 * The structured-output correction policy.
 *
 * `AgentAction.test.ts` covers the re-prompt itself: a decode miss spends a
 * correction slot and the action succeeds or reports a typed failure. These
 * cases cover the policy around it, which is what an operator configures and
 * what a crash has to survive:
 *
 * - the correction budget a composition defaults to, and the per-action
 *   override that beats it;
 * - the journal record each rejection leaves, so a run that answered three
 *   times says why in its own trail rather than only in its final failure;
 * - the bounded repair step after the budget is spent;
 * - and the durable half — a run killed mid-correction resumes at the
 *   correction it had reached and re-issues none of the calls it recorded.
 *
 * The durable cases run on the production engine over one in-memory SQLite
 * database, because replay is the thing under test and the memory engine
 * would answer it from a different mechanism.
