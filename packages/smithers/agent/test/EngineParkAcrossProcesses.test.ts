/**
 * What a durable park survives when the process that parked the run exits.
 *
 * A park is not a cancellation. `DurableEngineState` says so in its waiting
 * vocabulary: `timer`, `approval`, and `event` are runs waiting to be woken,
 * `released` is a run whose owner went away without settling it, and only an
 * operator cancel is terminal. The release validation found every one of those
 * collapsed into `cancelled`: `AgentSession`'s driver wrapped `engine.execute`
 * in an `Effect.onInterrupt` that called `engine.interrupt` — the DURABLE
 * cancel — for every interruption of the driver fiber, and a park and a
 * shutdown both interrupt it. The engine row was finalized `cancelled`, the
 * clock deadline was stamped completed 150 seconds before it fell due, and
 * `flows.engine.interrupted {"outcome":"cancelled"}` went into the journal of
 * a run nobody had cancelled.
 *
 * Every case here is two compositions over one pair of real SQLite files, and
 * the first composition's scope CLOSES between them: that close is the
 * detached `smithers up -d` process exiting, and it is the whole experiment.
 * The rows are then read with `node:sqlite` rather than through a service, so
 * the assertion is about what is on disk for the next process to find.
