/**
 * Scoped model-facing memory, through the path an agent run dispatches.
 *
 * `StandardFlows.memory(services, scope)` is what a host composes when one
 * run may reach exactly one memory namespace, the way a role in a team keeps
 * its own memory. The refusal that matters is the one a model meets, so every
 * call here is a `ctx.call` from a cell that a real `Agent` run executes on
 * the real durable engine: the cell's call is resolved from the run's catalog,
 * keyed, journaled, and dispatched through `FlowBinding`, and the handler
 * behind it writes to and recalls from the authoritative SQL memory store
 * (`TestMemory`, in-memory SQLite) through keyword recall. Only the model is
 * recorded.
 *
 * The store and recall service are observed, not replaced: each keeps its
 * real behaviour and also writes down what reached it, which is how "refused
 * before any I/O" is shown rather than inferred from a result.
