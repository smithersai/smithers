/**
 * An approval decided by a composition that does not host the run.
 *
 * release policy 5.1 promises that `Approve` on a `Node` target resumes the run
 * server-side, so a gateway client does not have to call `Resume` afterwards.
 * `ControlLive.decide` kept that promise by claiming the control row and
 * journaling `control.run.resumed` — and the only consumer of that entry was a
 * `journal.changes` subscription, an in-process `PubSub` that no other journal
 * instance can publish into (`SqlJournal.ts`, the `changes` hub). A decision
 * taken anywhere but inside the process hosting the executor therefore wrote a
 * wake nothing read, and `scope: "launched"` did not stop it: that scope is a
 * `control_runs` lookup, a durable table every process over one
 * `.flows/control.db` shares, so the deciding process TOOK the row from the
 * host that could still drive it (triage B-15).
 *
 * Three compositions over one control database prove all of it. `A` is the
 * host: the real control plane, the production `AgentSession` executor, and
 * the durable engine over its own `engine.db`, exactly as `NodeControl`
 * composes them. `B` is a second control plane over the same file under its
 * own owner identity, with no executor at all — a gateway that runs nothing.
 * `C` is what the shipped CLI actually is: a second control plane that ALSO
 * composes an executor over the SAME `engine.db`, so its engine can see and
 * resume `A`'s parked execution. `B` and `C` decide; `A` has to wake, and the
 * frame has to run on `A`'s engine — the note each composition writes is
 * tagged with the engine that wrote it, so the settled run says which process
 * drove it rather than merely that some process did.
