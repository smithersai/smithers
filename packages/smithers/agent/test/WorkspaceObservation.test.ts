/**
 * The measurement the loop's mutation accounting is built on.
 *
 * These cases fix what a measurement covers and what it deliberately does not:
 * a shell write moves it, a test run that only fills caches does not, and a
 * path that vanishes mid-walk is left out rather than failing the frame. The
 * controller only ever compares two measurements for equality, so the whole
 * contract is "the digest moves exactly when the tree the run is judged on
 * moves".
