/**
 * Case 32 — a checkpoint outlives the process that took it, and a reading taken
 * at one sees the pinned tree rather than the live one.
 *
 * `ctx.checkpoint` is the authoring name for this: a call that names a
 * checkpoint reads the tree as it was, so a "fails before, passes after" claim
 * is about two trees and not about whatever the working copy happened to hold
 * when the check ran. The pin is a git object named in repository config, not
 * a handle in a process — which is what makes the kill below meaningful.
 *
 * The refusals are part of the same contract: a path that is absolute, or that
 * climbs out of the checkout with `..`, would silently read the live tree while
 * the caller believed it was reading a pinned one. Both are refused with a
 * typed reason and nothing runs.
