/**
 * What each standard helper actually binds.
 *
 * A host composes `StandardFlows.filesystem(services)`, not the seven bindings
 * inside it, so the catalog a helper produces is this package's contract with
 * the model and with `docs/guides/capabilities.md`. Losing one line from a
 * binding array is invisible until a run reaches for the capability and finds
 * nothing there, which is the failure the filesystem list was written to end:
 * with only `read` and `write` bound, the built-in harness emitted
 * `apply_patch` heredocs into `bash`, watched the shell report
 * `apply_patch: command not found`, and finished runs claiming fixes it never
 * applied. These tests read the catalog each source produces and compare it
 * with the documented set, and run the two search bindings to prove they are
 * handed the `Search` the host supplied rather than the bare filesystem
 * context.
