/**
 * Golden vectors for the durable identities this package derives.
 *
 * A step key is a cache address. Every other case in this suite asserts a
 * RELATION between keys — two calls agree, two runs differ, a park replays —
 * and a relation survives a change that moves every key at once. Rewriting the
 * material a sealed model call hashes, or the composition token folded into a
 * cell call, makes previously recorded steps miss even while the relational
 * assertions all still hold. A live model host would dispatch those calls again.
 *
 * So these cases pin the exact strings. A failure needs its key material
 * investigated before the fixture changes. This 1.0 rewrite has not been
 * released; these vectors establish the baseline for its first release.
 * Deliberate future identity changes belong in CHANGELOG.md so hosts can
 * account for cache invalidation.
 *
 * Each key is read back through `Action.CurrentInvocationKey` inside the
 * dispatched activity, so what is pinned is the identity the ENGINE carried,
 * not a value recomputed from the same source the assertion is checking.
