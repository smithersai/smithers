/**
 * The executor's failure edges, one refusing collaborator at a time.
 *
 * `AgentSession.test.ts` drives the whole production stack along the path
 * where every collaborator answers. What that can never reach is the other
 * half of the composition: the control store, the journal, the decision store,
 * the status fence, the registry, and the durable engine each have a refusal
 * the executor must contain rather than propagate, and a stack whose
 * collaborators all work cannot produce one. So this file assembles the same
 * executor over stubs and refuses in exactly one place per case.
 *
 * Two collaborators stay real. The durable engine is `FlowEngine.layerMemory`,
 * so registration, execution, polling, and resumption behave as production
 * does; and the approval flow is the real `StandardFlows.approval` binding, so
 * an ask reads its decision exactly the way a cell's `ctx.call("ask", …)`
 * reaches it. The agent is a stub, because the loop itself is asserted in
 * `Agent.test.ts` — here it is the injection point for the two hooks the
 * executor hands it, `authorize` and the composed `ask` flow.

/**
 * The ordering a native host puts between its two independent writers.
 *
 * This executor journals `control.run.completed` from the flow body's exit,
 * inside the engine's registered handler. On the coding host the run's OUTPUT
 * reaches a reader by a second route entirely: the engine commits the round
 * after that handler returns, and a follower copies its
 * `flows.engine.run-decision` into the control journal afterwards. A gateway
 * folding the control journal between the two saw `completed` with no output,
 * which is how two production runs of `repository-jobs/issues` differed.
 *
 * `orderTerminalStatus` is the host's wait between them. Nothing here sleeps:
 * the hook IS the gate, so while it is parked the executor provably has no
 * other path to a terminal status, and the journal stub below signals the
 * exact write rather than a moment after it.
