/**
 * What a failed agent run leaves on disk for the next process to find.
 *
 * release validation ran the rc.0 CLI against a provider seat with no
 * credits. Every failure logged `engine-store: coordinated drain failed for
 * run-1 SchemaError: Expected JSON value at ["exit"]["cause"][0]["error"]`,
 * because `agent/run` declares both result channels `Schema.Unknown` and the
 * exit cause carried a `HarnessError` — a class instance, which
 * `Schema.Json` rejects. The drain died before the terminal transition, so
 * `.flows/control.db` `flows_runs` said `failed` while `.flows/engine.db`
 * `flows_runs` said `running` under a pid that had exited. Eighty-six seconds
 * later the next CLI process's stale-running sweep stole `run-1`, journaled
 * `stolen-and-activated`, `discipline-armed` and `turn-opened` for it, and
 * called the OpenAI seat again for a run the control plane had closed.
 *
 * The release policy allows one terminal write per run, and the release
 * promises a settled run is never re-executed. This is that pin: two
 * compositions over one pair of real SQLite files, the first composition's
 * scope CLOSING between them, a seat that counts every call, and a failure
 * whose cause is exactly the shape the codec rejects.
