/**
 * What a run that COMPLETED leaves on disk when its launching process exits.
 *
 * The release validation launched `hello` with `smithers run` and with
 * `smithers up -d`. Both were reported `completed` by the control plane and
 * both left `.flows/engine.db` `flows_runs` `suspended`/`released`, because
 * `AgentSession` writes `control.run.completed` from the flow body's exit
 * while the engine has yet to record the round's `Complete` result, and
 * `packages/smithers/src/Command.ts` `awaitRun` returns on that event and closes
 * the scope. The journal timed the gap at 10 to 14 ms: `control.run.completed`
 * at 1788163027537, `flows.engine.run-decision interrupt-released` at
 * 1788163027551. Every later process that composed an executor then claimed
 * the released row and replayed the agent turn — run-1 reached 162 journal
 * events and 16 run decisions across 11 pids, and its reported token count was
 * six times the truth.
 *
 * Two compositions over one pair of real SQLite files, the first composition's
 * scope closing on exactly the event the CLI closes on, and the rows read back
 * with `node:sqlite` because the pin is about what the next process finds.
