/**
 * Detached children, on the real durable engine and the real control plane.
 *
 * `ChildFlows` has shipped its three lifecycle flows with `makeNoop` as the
 * only implementation: every `agent/spawn` a cell wrote answered
 * `ChildError { code: "unsupported" }`, so the detached half of subflows was a
 * declaration and nothing else. `EngineChildren` is the implementation, and
 * what makes it worth having is that all three operations are DURABLE — the
 * child is a run row with its own claim and its own journal, not a fiber.
 *
 * Every case below composes the production `EngineStore` and the production
 * `ControlLive` over one SQLite database, so `send` travels the same path an
 * operator's steer does. Two cases go further:
 *
 * - `await` is proved across a real FILE. Two independently constructed store
 *   bundles open it in turn — two connections, two engines, and the first
 *   composition fully closed before the second opens — so the value the second
 *   answers with can only have come off disk.
 * - `send` is proved through the child's own turn boundary. The child drains
 *   the queue itself with the production `Harness.Notifications` source and
 *   returns what it read, so the assertion is on the child's OUTPUT rather
 *   than on a drain the test performed on the child's behalf.
