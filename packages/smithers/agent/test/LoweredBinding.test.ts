/**
 * A `@smthrs/std` signature, bound and called through the path the agent uses.
 *
 * `@smthrs/harness` `FlowBinding.Declared` is a structural interface: it names
 * six fields and imports no flow constructor. `@smthrs/core`'s `Flow.make`
 * answers `@smthrs/flow` values, so "the lowered value still satisfies it" is a
 * claim about a shape nothing checks at the seam. This asserts it against a
 * real declaration rather than a fixture shaped to fit, and then runs one call
 * end to end through `CellCalls`, which is the resolver `@smthrs/agent`'s cell
 * loop dispatches every `ctx.call` through.
