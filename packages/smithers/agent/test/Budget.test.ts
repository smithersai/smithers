/**
 * Token and latency budgets across a run's model calls.
 *
 * The sandbox bounds one cell and `maxFrames` bounds one loop, but nothing
 * accumulated what a run had spent across its steps, so an approved envelope
 * that says "this plan may spend a million tokens" bound nothing at all. These
 * cases cover the accumulator and the three things a composition can ask for
 * when a budget runs out: fail the step, warn and continue, or stop making
 * model calls at all.
 *
 * Two things carry the accumulator across a restart, and neither is a replay
 * of the step body. The engine resumes a run from its recorded NODE results
 * and never re-enters a settled step, so the budget writes what each call cost
 * on the journal's durable channel and PROJECTS that ledger back the first
 * time a run asks it anything. Keying by the model step's own content key is
 * what makes the projection safe: a recovered record and the live call it
 * describes are one key, so a call is never counted twice.
