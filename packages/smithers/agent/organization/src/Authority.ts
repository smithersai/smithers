/**
 * Who a role task runs as, decided by the host at dispatch.
 *
 * A role task's payload names its principal by id and the roster snapshot it
 * was composed against by revision; it never carries the principal's
 * profile or grants. The host resolves both from a trusted
 * {@link RosterRegistry} that only host code fills — from the organization's
 * files on disk — and a profile, grant, or prompt placed in a payload is
 * therefore either ignored (unknown keys are not read) or refused:
 *
 * - the revision must be one the registry pinned;
 * - the principal must be active, with every principal up its hiring chain
 *   active, both in the pinned snapshot and in the registry's current one, so
 *   pausing or retiring a principal or an ancestor stops tasks composed
 *   against an older snapshot;
 * - the pinned grants must still be inside the current grants;
 * - the seat must be the profile's seat;
 * - the composition (common instructions, charter, skills, task, context)
 *   is recomposed from the snapshot and must match the payload's digest and
 *   prompt exactly;
 * - a workspace must be granted, belong to a granted repository, and have
 *   been prepared by the same execution.
 *
 * {@link layer} installs these checks around the `organization/role-task`
 * handlers of an action layer, the way `flows/coding/planning-authority.ts`
 * wraps evidence actions: it wraps `FlowRuntime.register` and
 * `Action.Implementations.add`, reads the composition's `AgentAction.Host`
 * at execution, and runs the handler under a {@link RoleHost} built for the
 * principal and under `CapabilitySet.attenuate` of that host's envelope.
