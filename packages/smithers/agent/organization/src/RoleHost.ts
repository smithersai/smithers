/**
 * The per-invocation agent host of one role task.
 *
 * A role task runs as an ordinary `AgentAction`; what differs per principal is
 * the host it runs under. {@link make} builds that host from the principal's
 * profile alone — never from anything the task payload says — and from the
 * resources the organization host configured:
 *
 * - **registry**: only the skills the profile lists; every other name is
 *   absent, for listing, lookup, body loading, and prompt runs alike.
 * - **flows**: only the tool families the profile grants. `memory` binds
 *   `StandardFlows.memory` scoped to the principal's own bank, so a call
 *   naming another bank fails `invalid_namespace` before any store I/O.
 *   `wiki-read` binds {@link wikiRead}, which reads only files the knowledge
 *   grants cover, confined by real path. `workspace` binds the standard file
 *   and shell flows to a sandbox session's filesystem and spawner, with the
 *   container transport refused, so every command and edit happens in the
 *   machine. `retrieval` binds {@link webFetch}, a read-only public page
 *   fetch inside the grant's domain scope that records each page it
 *   retrieved; a host that opts in also offers the model provider's own web
 *   search (restricted to the allowed domains) on every model call, unless
 *   the scope denies domains the provider cannot be told to skip. `wiki-write` and
 *   `delegate` bind nothing yet. A granted family whose resource the host
 *   did not configure fails the composition rather than quietly running
 *   without it.
 * - **capability envelope**: exactly the capabilities the bound flows
 *   declare, plus reading the served root's paths a sealed memory call
 *   declares, which the engine measures before recording the call. A
 *   principal without `workspace` therefore has no shell or file flow at all.
 * - **system**: the host's teaching, then the principal's composed system
 *   prompt (common instructions, charter, skills).
 *
 * The standard `write`, `edit`, and `apply_patch` flows are compensable, so
 * the engine snapshots before each call. {@link snapshotBoundary} makes that
 * snapshot a tree of the machine's workspace, never of the host repository.
 *
 * Plugins, host implementations, and host flow sources of the base host are
 * never inherited.
