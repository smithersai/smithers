# @smthrs/agent

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `SeatResolver.contextWindowTokensFor` now re-exports
  `ModelCatalog.contextWindowTokensFor` from `@smthrs/model`, where the provider
  window table now lives. The resolved numbers are unchanged.
- `AgentSession.trace` types every event type it journals as
  `Transcript.ControlEventType`, so the `control.agent.` namespace this package
  writes and the one `Transcript.validateJournal` reads back cannot drift apart
  without a compile error.

- Preserve the sealed cell-call key and encoded result schema from before A2
  admission hardening. Success/failure validation remains at construction and
  decoding, and the port validates host results before persistence with typed
  causes. The pre-A2 golden `key1_8ab29627...` is unchanged, with canonical
  material and SQLite reopen/resume regressions. Intermediate builds with the
  result-schema filter require finishing their runs on that build; no stored
  key or approval is rewritten.

- Approval asks now read the explicit durable `Approved` or `Denied` token
  instead of inferring a decision from grants. Pending or unreadable decisions
  fail closed; denial still returns `approved: false` to the caller.

- `AgentSession.requestCancel` now records logical-run intent atomically across
  trampoline rounds. A completed predecessor no longer makes a live successor
  look terminal. Execution observation follows the current round's lifecycle
  while preserving the requested run's identity; see the API's snapshot and
  separate-control-database limits.

- Validate every supplied usage counter before choosing or aggregating a token
  total. Negative or non-finite components cannot be hidden by a valid total or
  cancel against another attempt. `tokensOf` returns `NaN` for malformed
  components; durable accounting refuses them without poisoning the tally.
- Budget acquisition now validates and snapshots its configuration, failing with
  `Budget.ConfigurationError` for invalid ceilings, exceeded policies, or cache
  bounds. `make`, `layer`, `layerFromEnvelope`, and `AgentSession.Options.budget`
  expose that typed failure. Omit ceilings for no limit; infinity is not valid.
- Reported usage before an unsealed capacity refusal or stream interruption is
  charged under a distinct invocation receipt. It survives journal recovery
  without giving a later provider retry a paid sealed-step marker. Partial
  failed text is still discarded; cumulative counters count once per attempt.
- The model action's encoded failure contract includes infrastructure failures
  from receipt allocation and usage persistence. Corrected its stale unreleased
  golden to `key1_b5b3584a…`: review baseline `a49b68ef7d` and the release fixes
  produce byte-identical canonical preimages under Effect `4.0.0-rc.112`, with
  the cell-call golden unchanged. This is a fixture correction for the first
  release, with no runtime or schema alteration. Schema representation is key
  material, so future dependency upgrades must verify these vectors as well.

## [1.0.0-rc.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Added `defaultModelRetryWindowMillis` (45,000 ms), a wall clock on the transport retry ladder. Five rungs bounds how many attempts are made, not what they cost: r92 of the SWE-bench full benchmark burned ten `transport` retries and $0.85 across two instances against a socket that stayed dead for half a minute, and each of those attempts re-sent a whole prompt and streamed a partial body before dying. The window is the declared ladder's own jittered ceiling plus a rung's headroom, so a transport that fails fast still gets all five rungs, while one whose attempts are slow stops when the window closes. Elapsed time is the schedule's own, on the injected clock.

- `AgentSession.trace` now journals `control.agent.vacuous-verification-observed` with its payload — the stored check, the flow, and the controller's identity for that call — rather than letting it fall through to an empty one. The control that emits it is unwired from `CellTurn` as of the r93 verdict, so no new run produces the row; the mapping stays so the r93 journals that carry it keep reading and so a controlled re-measure needs no change here.

- Added `StandardFlows.tests`, which binds `@smthrs/std`'s `test` flow to a
  host's `TestRunner` declaration. A tool no production composition offers is a
  tool that does not exist, which is the same reason all seven filesystem flows
  are bound rather than two.

- `StandardFlows.shell` now supplies a `Container` transport, defaulting to the
  docker/podman CLI, so `bash`'s `container` field means something in the
  production composition. Without one the field resolves `{ ok: false }` with
  "this host has no container transport", and the agent goes back to typing
  `docker exec c bash -lc '…'` itself — the quoting stack that cost the measured
  SWE-bench program twelve failed probes and one instance's most expensive frame.
  A host with a different route passes its own transport; a host with neither
  docker nor podman fails the spawn with the shell's own "not found", which is
  the honest answer.

- Journaled `control.agent.discipline-armed` once at run start with the
  read-only and frame caps and every effective sandbox limit, so a run that
  never reaches completion still proves what it armed.

- Added `Agent.Options.readOnlyCap`, armed by `AgentSession` for every task run
  (`AgentSession.Options.readOnlyCap`, default `CellTurn.defaultReadOnlyFrames`).
  It caps consecutive frames that write nothing; a run that is meant only to
  answer leaves it unset.
- Journaled `durationMillis` on `control.agent.model-settled`, the wall-clock
  duration of that one sealed model call.
- Added `Seat`: the resolved seat record, `Seat.modelIdOf`, and the typed
  `Seat.SeatUnresolved` failure. The declared half stays an unvalidated string,
  because the resolver owns the seat vocabulary.
- Added `SeatResolver`, the host seam that turns a declared seat string into a
  live model. `AgentSession` and `AgentAction` both take it as a service instead
  of a `resolveSeat` option, so a composition installs one resolver rather than
  threading a function through every entry point. The context-window catalog
  moved here as `SeatResolver.contextWindowTokensFor`.

- Placed the run's task prompt in a prefix segment so it survives every frame; it previously lived in the rebuilt tail and vanished after frame one.
- Widened the sealed step's transient retry to five one-second-doubling attempts; a destroyed HTTP/2 session outlives a half-second backoff.

- Made agent reasoning effort configurable: the flow's `effort:` frontmatter wins, then the host's `Options.reasoningEffort`, then the `high` default.

- Defaulted every executor-launched run to medium reasoning effort; an unset effort left the model with near-zero thinking budget.

- Added durable `control.agent.*` trail projections with occurrence timestamps
  and bounded failure causes for executor runs.
- Added workspace-relative file boundary conversion for cell calls.
- Added transient sealed-model retries while preserving non-retryable model
  failures.

- Added package-owned documentation: `docs/Manifest.ts`, `docs/`, and
  `scripts/docs.mjs` generate `docs/pages/api/agent.md` from the package's own
  JSDoc and prose, so the API page has one source rather than three.

### Changed

- Production `Agent.run` now reports each failed `configResolved` observer as
  one warning with only its stable code, plugin, and hook. Startup remains
  nonfatal and the observer cause is never copied into the log record.
- Renamed the cost field of the durable `flows.agent.usage.v1` payload from
  `tokens` to `spent`, and gave the payload an owning schema,
  `Budget.UsageRecord`. `@smthrs/journal`'s redactor strips one trailing plural
  and tests the suffix, so `tokens` read as a credential and the production
  `SqlJournal` persisted `"[REDACTED]"` where the number was. Every usage record
  written under a real journal therefore came back unreadable, and the old read
  side dropped it silently, so a resumed run recovered nothing and was handed
  its whole token allowance again. Records written under the old name do not
  decode; they never carried a readable number either.
- Made durable budget recovery fail closed. A `flows.agent.usage.v1` or
  `flows.agent.budget-started.v1` record that does not decode now raises
  `Budget.AccountingUnavailable` naming the entry's sequence and journal source,
  instead of contributing nothing to the ledger.
- Made the latency budget's clock zero durable. The first budget question of a
  run writes `Budget.budgetStartedEvent`, and a later incarnation recovers the
  earliest recorded zero, so a park, reclaim, or process restart no longer
  re-arms the whole `milliseconds` allowance.
- Fixed `QuotaPolicy.parseDelay` reading "retry after 5 minutes" as five
  seconds. The `retry-after` pattern made its unit optional, so a minute- or
  hour-scale wait woke sixty or thirty-six hundred times too early and burned
  every park the step was allowed.
- Fixed the bare `Retry-After` pattern reading a PREFIX of a number whose unit
  it does not know. Its trailing lookahead forbade a unit word but not a digit,
  which a shorter capture satisfies: `Retry-After: 120ms` parked for twelve
  seconds and `Retry after 12 days` for one. An unknown unit now falls back to
  `defaultWaitMillis`, which is what the module always claimed it did.
- Made `StandardFlows.clock` clamp an invalid `maxSeconds` to
  `defaultMaxWaitSeconds` instead of comparing against it. `NaN` made every
  ceiling test false and `Infinity` admitted an unbounded park, so a host could
  remove the wait bound while the documentation said hosts may only lower it.
- Bounded the remaining two trail fields at `AgentSession.maxTracedBytes`:
  `cell-call-started`'s input and `cell-call-settled`'s failure message. A
  `write` carries its whole file in the input and a test runner writes megabytes
  of message, so only the result value was actually bounded.
- Made `AgentSession.launch` carry the registry's typed failure on
  `LaunchFailed.cause` rather than its `toString`. `body_unavailable` and
  `body_unreadable` need different operator answers and a stringified cause
  offers no field to route on.
- Made `AgentSession.settlementFailure` render a non-JSON PRIMITIVE as text.
  `JSON.stringify` does not refuse `Infinity` and `NaN`, it rewrites both to
  `null`, so an arithmetic failure settled as the same recorded value as a run
  that failed with a literal `null`. The JSON round trip is now reserved for
  objects.
- Made a child start that succeeds without creating a run row a
  `ChildError { code: "failed" }`. `not_found` is the answer that tells a cell
  the flow does not exist here, and the declaration had already been found, so
  spending it on a runtime's refusal told the cell to give up on a flow it has.
- Made a latched `skip-remaining` budget report the refusal it actually latched
  on. A latency latch previously answered every later call with a fabricated
  `tokens` scope and `max: 0`.
- Added `cause` to `Budget.AccountingUnavailable`, so the journal error under an
  accounting failure keeps its tag and fields instead of being stringified.
- Taught `packages/agent/scripts/docs.mjs` to follow named re-exports. It read
  documented declarations and `export *` forms only, so
  `FlowEngineLike.defaultModelOverruns`, published with an `export { }` clause,
  had no row in the generated table. A re-exported member the target module does
  not document now fails the generator rather than disappearing from the page.
- Renamed the package from `@smthrs/engine-harness` to `@smthrs/agent`. The
  package is named for what it ships: the Smithers agent, plus the two adapters
  that run it.
- Renamed `CellHarness` to `Agent` and made it a `Context.Service`. The loop is
  reached through the `Agent` tag rather than a bare `run` export, so a future
  agent that drives a foreign CLI is another implementation of the same service.
  `Agent.layer` provides the production one, `Agent.layerNoop` a silent one, and
  `Agent.layerDefaults` the browser-safe sandbox and steering defaults the old
  `CellHarness.layer` provided.
- Renamed `HarnessExecutor` to `AgentSession`, and its durable flow id from
  `engine-harness/agent` to `agent/run`.
- Collapsed `Options.seat` / `model` / `route` / `contextWindowTokens` into one
  resolved `Seat.Seat`. There is now exactly one resolved-seat record, produced
  only by a `SeatResolver`.
- Changed the composition identity folded into every step key this package
  derives from `flows/engine-harness/composition/v1:` to
  `flows/agent/composition/v1:` (`FlowEngineLike.ts`). Every step cached under
  the old prefix therefore misses. That is intentional: pre-release identity
  strings track module paths, and the package moved.
- Changed the failure an `AgentAction` reports when the host cannot serve its
  declared seat. It is now `Seat.SeatUnresolved` rather than a `HarnessError`,
  and `AgentAction.AgentFailure` carries the new member.

### Removed

- Removed `FlowEngineLike.ChildRunner`, `FlowEngineLike.appendBatch`,
  `FlowEngineLike.Options.children`, and `FlowEngineLike.Options.plan`.
  `splice` now refuses an elaborated batch because the cell loop superseded
  the provider-tool-call path, and rc.0 does not ship API it does not support.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-05
