/**
 * Replay-stable scorer sampling.
 *
 * A ratio policy decides from the target step key, the scorer key, and the
 * seed alone, so the same step reaches the same decision on every replay and
 * in every process. Two properties make that promise real, and both were once
 * broken here:
 *
 * - The hash runs over UTF-8 *bytes*. Hashing UTF-16 code units through
 *   `charCodeAt(0)` read only the high surrogate of an astral code point, so
 *   every emoji in the same 1024-code-point block hashed identically.
 * - The three components are length-prefixed rather than joined with a
 *   delimiter. `"a:b" + ":" + "c"` and `"a" + ":" + "b:c"` produce the same
 *   `":"`-joined material, so two unrelated steps shared one decision.
 *
 * Both are silent collisions, which is why `test/Sampling.test.ts` freezes
 * golden hash vectors: a change to either rule moves every sampling decision
 * already recorded downstream and has to be a deliberate, noted change.
