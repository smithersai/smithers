 * a judge whose prose quotes the agent output it graded. The byte bounds do
 * not help, because a bearer token, an `Authorization` header, or a URL with
 * embedded credentials fits inside the first kilobyte.
 *
 * The journal's own rule set is used rather than a second one, so both durable
 * prose surfaces of this database scrub the same shapes. `onTooDeep` names a
