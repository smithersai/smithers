/**

 * through its broker and hands the client an `AccessTokenSource`, which is
 * where an OAuth refresh happens. The environment may still name the API
 * origin, for a fixture server.
 *
 * Binding a `Connection` gives the client the connection id its receipts and
 * records carry, and the scopes the provider actually granted, so an
 * operation the grant does not cover fails as `permission-denied` before any
 * request is sent.
