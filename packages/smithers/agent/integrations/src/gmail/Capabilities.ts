/**
 * What a Gmail connection can do, stated as data.
 *
 * Each operation this package performs is declared once, with the OAuth
 * scopes Google accepts for it. A host reads the table to show what a
 * connection's grant allows, and the client consults it before every request,
 * so an operation the grant does not cover fails as `permission-denied`
 * naming the scopes it needs, instead of reaching Google and failing there or,
 * worse, succeeding under a broader grant than the operator meant to use.
 *
 * `personalAccount` records the nature of the provider: a Gmail connection is
 * someone's own mailbox. Which principal may use it is host policy; this
 * module only states the fact that policy needs.
