/**
 * Slack Events API ingress over HTTP.
 *
 * Slack signs `v0:<timestamp>:<raw body>` with the app's signing secret and
 * sends the hex digest as `X-Slack-Signature: v0=<hex>` beside
 * `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp`. A valid signature stays valid forever, so the
 * timestamp must also be fresh: {@link verify} refuses one more than five
 * minutes from now, which is the window Slack documents.
 *
 * Two answers belong to the HTTP host rather than to `Channels.ingest`, which
 * returns a control receipt. Slack's `url_verification` check wants its
 * `challenge` echoed, and a delivery the policy refuses (another workspace, an
 * unlisted channel, the app's own message) should be acknowledged with a 200
 * rather than refused with a 4xx, which Slack would retry and eventually count
 * against the app. {@link answer} makes that decision before ingest, and the
 * channel's decoder enforces the same policy again, so an ingress that skips
 * {@link answer} is still gated.
 *
 * Slack retries a delivery it did not see acknowledged, with the same body.
 * {@link idempotencyKey} is the delivery identity `slack:<team>:<event id>`, so
 * `Channels.ingest` drops the retry.
 *
 * Block Kit interactions over HTTP arrive form-encoded and are not handled
 * here; Socket Mode delivers them through `Slack.SocketSource`.
