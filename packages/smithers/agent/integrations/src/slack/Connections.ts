/**
 * Which Slack connection an action reaches the workspace through.
 *
 * A durable Slack action names a `connectionId` and a channel in its payload,
 * and both are journal-safe data. The host decides what they mean: it builds
 * one {@link Resolved} per configured `Connection`, each with a client whose
 * tokens come from the credential broker, and provides them as
 * {@link SlackConnections}. Resolution is where the connection's container
 * allowlist is enforced: an action may only post to a channel the connection
 * lists, and an unknown connection or an unlisted channel is refused
 * `permission-denied` before any request is made. An empty container list
 * admits nothing; `"*"` (`Connection.ANY_CONTAINER`) admits every channel,
 * which is what a host that answers an owner's direct messages needs before
 * it knows their `D…` ids.
 *
 * Two constructors build a {@link Resolved}. {@link fromEnvironment} reads the
 * bot and app tokens from `SMITHERS_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and
 * `SMITHERS_SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, for a local host with one Slack app.
 * {@link fromConnection} asks the credential broker for each token at the
 * moment a call needs it, through `Connection.resolveSecret`, so the host
 * policy decides first and the token is never held in configuration. Either
 * way a token stays `Redacted` until it reaches the `Authorization` header.
