/**

 * the loop around that: it reads the cursor, polls, runs the handler, and
 * commits the proposed cursor only after the handler succeeds. A process that
 * dies mid-batch therefore re-polls the batch instead of skipping it, and the
 * redelivered events are dropped downstream on their dedupe keys.
 *
 * A poll that finds nothing proposes no cursor, which leaves the stored one
 * alone.
