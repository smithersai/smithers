/**
 * A configured provider connection, as journal-safe data.

 * A connection names a provider account the host holds a credential for, the
 * scopes the provider actually granted, and the containers (channels,
 * repositories, calendars) it may be used with. It never carries the secret:
 * `credential` is a control-plane `CredentialRef`, resolved through the
 * credential broker only at dispatch, so the value can appear in a flow
 * payload, a plan, or a journal entry.
 *
 * `personal` marks a connection to a person's own account. Which principals
 * may resolve its credential is a host authorization decision: `resolveSecret`
 * asks the host's `authorize` hook for the principal and the connection before
 * it touches the credential broker, and `personalPolicy` is the fail-closed
 * shape of that hook, under which only the named principals resolve personal
 * connections.
