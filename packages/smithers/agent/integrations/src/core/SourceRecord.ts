 * retrieved or placed in a prompt, is the same set of facts: which provider
 * and connection it came from, its stable external identity and link, who
 * wrote it and when, which version this is, when it was retrieved, who may
 * read it, and which thread it belongs to. `SourceRecord` is that set.
 *
 * `text` is the provider adapter's searchable rendering of the payload; it is
 * data, never instructions. `deleted` marks a tombstone: the provider removed
 * the object, so its payload and text are empty and retrieval never returns it.
