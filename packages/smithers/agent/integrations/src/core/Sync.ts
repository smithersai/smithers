/**
 * The provider half of source synchronization.
 *
 * A provider adapter answers one question: what changed after this cursor.
 * The first call passes `null` and receives the initial pages; later calls
 * pass the cursor the previous batch returned. A provider that invalidates a
 * cursor (Google's `410 Gone` on a stale sync token) answers `reset: true`,
 * which tells the driver that the batch is a fresh full listing and anything
 * it does not contain is gone.
 *
 * The driver owns durability: it applies a batch and advances the stored
 * cursor in one transaction, so a crash between them re-reads the batch
 * rather than skipping it, and applying the same batch twice is a no-op.
 *
 * `runSync` is that driver. It reads the stream's committed cursor from the
 * `SourceStore`, asks the adapter for the next page, and hands the page to
 * `SourceStore.commit`, which applies the records, advances the cursor under
 * the key `connectionId:stream`, and, when a `reset` listing completes,
 * tombstones every record of the stream the listing did not contain. It stops
 * when the adapter reports `done` or the page budget runs out; the next run
 * resumes from the committed cursor, including a full listing still in
 * progress. A revoked connection is refused before the adapter is called.
 *
