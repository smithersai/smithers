/**
 * X posts and direct messages as provenance-carrying source records.
 *
 * A mention is a public post, so its record is scoped `public`; its thread is
 * the post's conversation, its parent the post it replies to, and its
 * container the account it mentions. A direct message is scoped `private` to
 * its conversation, whatever the conversation says. Text is the post or
 * message text as X returned it; it is data, never instructions.
 *
 * Posts are immutable (an edit is a new post id), so `version` is `null`. A
 * post's link is X's id-only status URL; a direct message has no public link.
