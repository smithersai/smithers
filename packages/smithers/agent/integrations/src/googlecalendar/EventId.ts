/**
 * Deterministic Google Calendar event ids.
 *
 * Google lets a client choose an event's id on insert, and refuses a second
 * insert of the same id with a 409. That makes the id the idempotency key an
 * event write otherwise lacks: derive it from what the event *is* (a meeting
 * series, one principal's slot), and a retried or replayed insert names the
 * same event instead of creating a second one.
 *
 * Google's rules for a caller-chosen id: only the base32hex alphabet
 * (lowercase `a`-`v` and the digits), between 5 and 1024 characters, unique
 * per calendar. {@link fromKey} is the SHA-256 of the key in that alphabet,
 * 52 characters, so any key yields a valid id and distinct keys collide only
 * as SHA-256 does.
 *
 * Ids a caller did not choose are looser: Google's generated ids and the
 * instance ids of a recurring series (the series id, an underscore, and the
 * original start) fall outside base32hex. {@link EventReference} accepts
 * those for reads, patches and deletes; only an insert needs {@link EventId}.
