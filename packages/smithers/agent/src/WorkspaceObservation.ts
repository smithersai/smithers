/**
 * Measuring the workspace a run is changing, so the loop's mutation
 * accounting is a fact rather than a claim.
 *
 * `@smthrs/harness` declares the port
 * (`EngineLike.observe`) and states why it exists. This module is the
 * production answer to it: a pruned walk of the workspace root that reads a
 * cheap identity off every file it keeps and folds the lot into one digest.
 * Two measurements taken around a frame answer "did this frame change the
 * tree", which is the question `bash` makes unanswerable from declarations —
 * a spawned process writes wherever it likes and tells nobody.
 *
 * These properties are the design:
 *
 * - **Identity, not content.** Each kept file contributes its path, its size,
 *   and its modification time. Reading every byte would be the stronger
 *   measurement and it costs the whole tree twice per frame; size and mtime
 *   move for every write a shell command can perform, including the redirect
 *   that started this. A rewrite that restores the byte count *and* the
 *   timestamp is invisible here, and that is the stated limit.
 * - **Pruning is the signal.** An unpruned walk reports a mutation every time
 *   the run executes anything: `pytest` writes `__pycache__`, a build writes
 *   `.so` files beside their sources, `git` rewrites its own index. Those are
 *   derived artifacts, not the work a run is judged on, and counting them
 *   would keep the read-only cap permanently satisfied — the same blindness
 *   the measurement exists to remove, inverted. {@link defaultPrune} and
 *   {@link defaultIgnoreSuffixes} name what is skipped and both are
 *   injectable, so a host whose derived artifacts differ declares its own.
 * - **A vanished path is not an error.** Paths are listed and then measured,
 *   and a background process the run spawned can remove one in between. Such a
 *   path is left out of the measurement rather than failing it: the tree moved,
 *   and the next measurement will say so.
 * - **A partial walk says so.** The walk stops at {@link Options.maxPaths}, and
 *   a measurement that stopped there covers a prefix. It reports
 *   `complete: false`, and the controller then decides changed-ness from what
 *   the frame's calls declared rather than from a prefix that may never have
 *   looked at the files being edited. Listing and stat failures other than
 *   `NotFound` also make the walk partial, and emit warning diagnostics with
 *   the failed operation, path, and cause.
 * - **A symlink is not part of the tree.** Every symlink is skipped whole:
 *   never measured, never descended into. That is what keeps the walk inside
 *   the root on any filesystem, including one whose `stat` follows links.
 *
 * ## The filesystem to hand this
 *
 * The host's own `FileSystem`, not the kernel-guarded one — and the difference
 * is not a detail. A guarded operation is resolved, authorized, re-resolved and
 * then executed relative to a pinned root descriptor, which on Node is one
 * helper process per call. This walk performs one call per file, so guarding it
 * bills a process for every file in the checkout, twice per frame. SWE-bench
 * wave 6 measured 88–123 ms per path that way: django's opening walk ran 912 s
 * of a 1,200 s budget and the run never reached its first tool call. Running the
 * calls concurrently does not repair it — sixteen helper processes in flight
 * still bill a process per file, because the cost is the call and not the wait.
 *
 * Nothing is given up, because the guard has nothing to decide here:
 *
 * - **Stat only.** The walk lists directories and reads metadata. It never
 *   opens a file, never reads a byte, never writes, and never creates a
 *   descriptor — so the confinement a descriptor-bound authorization exists to
 *   protect has nothing to bind to.
 * - **Root-confined.** Every path is a listed entry name appended to a
 *   directory the walk already reached from the root it was constructed with.
 *   No path comes from a model, a tool call, or a file's contents, and no
 *   symlink is followed, so no name the walk builds can leave the root.
 * - **Host equipment.** The root is chosen by whoever composed the workspace.
 *   This service is not reachable from a cell: it answers one question the
 *   controller asks about the tree, and returns a digest and a count.
 *
 * The one behaviour that does change is that the kernel refuses a hard-linked
 * regular file and this walk measures one, which is the answer a measurement
 * wants: an edit through either name moves the tree.
