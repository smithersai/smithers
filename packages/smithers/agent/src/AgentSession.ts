/**
 * One control-plane launch, run as one durable agent session.
 *
 * This is the production `ControlExecutor`. `ControlLive.run` resolves the
 * executor through `Effect.serviceOption`, and until this module existed
 * nothing provided one, so every accepted run stayed `pending` forever. What it
 * does is take a stored plan, find the flow's descriptor and prompt body in the
 * registry, resolve the flow's declared seat through {@link SeatResolver}, and
 * run {@link module:Agent} as the body of one durable flow execution whose id
 * is the control run id.
 *
 * The session is the adapter, not the agent. Everything about how a frame is
 * built, sealed, and replayed belongs to `Agent`; what belongs here is the
 * control-plane half — status fencing, the resume bridge, the approval gate,
 * and the journal trail.
 *
 * What the composition declares, because the spec says a host must:
 *
 * - **Explicit sandbox limits.** `Options.limits` is required; an unlimited
 *   QuickJS cell can hang the frame, so there is no default-unlimited path.
 * - **A resolved context window.** `Seat.contextWindowTokens` comes back from
 *   the host's `SeatResolver`, so compaction is armed instead of silently
 *   disabled at zero. `SeatResolver.contextWindowTokensFor` is the catalog for
 *   known models.
 * - **Steering from the durable queue.** The `Steering.Source` is
 *   `@smthrs/harness/Notifications` over the same journal-backed queue
 *   `Control.steer` admits into, so an operator steer reaches the loop at the
 *   next frame boundary.
 * - **Approval through control.** The `ask` flow is gated in the `authorize`
 *   hook — before the durable boundary opens — by registering an in-run
 *   approval token (`ControlRuntime.registerApproval`) and failing with an
 *   encoded `Permission.PermissionRequired`, which the controller turns into
 *   a real durable park. `Control.approve` resolves the token and installs
 *   the grant; the resumed attempt re-asks against the grant store as it now
 *   stands and proceeds. The park is decided outside the activity on purpose:
 *   a requirement raised inside one would be journaled and replayed forever.
 *
 * Run-status writes stay fenced: the executor waits for the control plane's
 * own `running` transition before the engine starts, writes
 * `waiting-approval` when the execution parks, and writes the terminal status
 * when it settles. Resumption is event-driven — the executor follows the
 * journal for the control plane's resume events and re-drives the parked
 * engine execution.
 *
 * Prior art: Effect's workflow runtime (register/execute/poll/resume), adapted
 * by `@smthrs/engine`, and OpenCode's scope-owned background session driver.
 * These are upstream designs, not paths in this repository.

/**
 * The journal projection of one agent event.
 *
 * The executor consumes the harness stream itself, so without this the whole
 * transcript — what the model said, the cell it produced, the flows that cell
 * called, and why a frame was rejected — existed only for the duration of the
 * run and a settled run could not be read back at all. Model deltas are the
 * one omission: they are the token-by-token prefix of `model-settled`, and
 * journaling them would multiply a run's event count by its token count for
 * no information the settlement does not already carry.
 *
 * `undefined` means "not journaled".
 *
 * `previous` is what the last `model-requested` of the same scope and purpose
 * said, and only that record reads it: see {@link RequestTrail}. Without one
 * the request is written whole, which is what a caller projecting one event on
 * its own wants. A caller projecting a run's events in order uses
 * {@link tracer}, which keeps it.

/**
 * Completes the `WaitFor` wait point a run is parked on with a signal's
 * payload.
 *
 * The wait point is read off the run's own waiting row rather than derived from
 * the flow, because the engine writes the deferred's token there when it parks
 * (`WaitFor.layer` annotates `reason: "event"` with the token). That makes the
 * bridge flow-agnostic: it completes whatever wait point the parked run
 * actually declared, through the ordinary `DurableDeferred.succeed` path every
 * other resolver uses, and the engine's own `scheduleResume` re-drives the run.
 *
 * The three answers are distinct on purpose. `delivered` completed a wait
 * point. `no-match` means the run IS parked and is waiting for something else —
 * a different signal name, an approval, a timer — which `Control.signal`
 * refuses rather than recording a delivery nothing consumes. `unknown` means
 * this executor can see no open wait point at all, which is not the same as
 * knowing there is none: another process may own the run, or it may not have
 * parked yet, and the recorded message is what a later start replays.
 *
 * A `delivered` answer also records the resume it is owed, through
 * `ControlRuntime.requestResume`. Completing the wait point is not on its own
 * enough to restart the run: {@link make}'s round guard re-enters a parked run
 * only for a delegation somebody recorded, and the only other caller of
 * `requestResume` is `ControlLive.decide`, which records one for an approval
 * TOKEN. Every ask answered by completing a wait point instead — each
 * `HumanTask` and `WaitFor` park, which is how the repository flows ask and how
 * the gateway routes `Approval.Submit` on a human wait — would otherwise settle
 * its deferred and leave the run parked on the question it had just answered.

     * - `parkedBy` this session wrote: this is the host. It takes its own

     * - Somebody else's `parkedBy`: not this composition's run to drive, so
     *   the delegation is left standing for the host that parked it — until
     *   it has stood unanswered for `options.abandonedParkAfter`, defaulting
