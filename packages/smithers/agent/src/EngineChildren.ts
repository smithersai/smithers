/**
 * The durable half of {@link ChildFlows}: detached children as real runs.
 *
 * `ChildFlows` declares `agent/spawn`, `agent/send`, and `agent/await` and
 * leaves the lifecycle behind the injected {@link ChildFlows.Children} port,
 * because nothing in a browser-safe package can honestly claim to persist a
 * detached run. This module is the implementation a host with a durable engine
 * supplies. Every operation is a durable one:
 *
 * - `spawn` starts a run of its own — a separate row, a separate claim, a
 *   separate journal — linked to the caller through the engine's parent-edge
 *   table. It is spawned with the result DISCARDED, which is what records
 *   `onParentExit: "detach"` on the child, so the child outlives the run that
 *   started it instead of being cancelled with it.
 * - `await` reads the child's settled result out of the run store, so it works
 *   from a different engine, a different process, and a later incarnation than
 *   the one that spawned it.
 * - `send` steers the child through the control plane, which admits a durable
 *   `human-steer` message the child drains at its next turn boundary.
 *
 * **What it is allowed to touch.** Three services and no more: the flow
 * runtime that starts and polls executions, the run store that says whether a
 * child exists, and the control plane that steers one. It reaches into no
 * engine internals — the engine's own state document is read through the one
 * public field `RunStore.RunRow.stateJson`, projected down to the single key
 * this port needs (see {@link ChildState}) — so the port composes over any
 * runtime that satisfies those three contracts rather than over one engine
 * implementation.
 *
 * **Whose children it reaches.** `await` and `send` take the child id as a
 * plain string a cell writes, so a call made inside a run is restricted to
 * that run's own child namespace — the ids `childExecutionId` derives from its
 * execution id. Without that, the string was a selector over every run the host
 * could see, and a cell that learned another run's id read its result and
 * steered it. A call made from OUTSIDE any run is the host collecting a child
 * of its own, which is the cross-process path below and is not model-reachable:
 * such a caller composed this port and already holds the run store and the
 * control plane it reads and steers through.
 *
 * The one thing it does not do is park the caller. `await` waits by re-reading
 * the child's run row on an interval rather than suspending the run, so a cell
 * that awaits a long child holds its round open. That is a bounded, honest cost of
 * the port's shape — `Children.await` answers with a value — and the note is
 * here rather than in a comment on the loop because it is the operation's
 * contract, not an implementation detail.
