/**
 * The Smithers agent.
 *
 * `Agent` is the agent: the production agent loop composed on the durable
 * engine. `AgentSession` runs it as one durable control-plane run. `AgentAction`
 * runs it as one typed step inside a larger flow. `Seat` and `SeatResolver` are
 * how a declaration picks a model without holding a credential; the rest of the
 * package is the capability catalog a run is given and the engine port it runs
 * on.
