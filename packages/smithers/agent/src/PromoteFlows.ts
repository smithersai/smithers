/**
 * Turning the script the model just ran into a saved flow, as two ordinary
 * flows.
 *
 * A run that solved something once solved it as a script: a few cells that read
 * the right things, called the right boundaries, and printed an answer. The
 * only thing standing between that script and a flow anyone can call again is
 * writing it down. These two bindings are that move, split where the model has
 * to think:
 *
 * - `flows/show-script` hands the model its own turn back — the source of every
 *   cell it executed, in order — together with the rules a saved flow has to
 *   follow and the file skeleton to fill in. It reads the
 *   {@link CellHistory.CellHistory} the controller records into, so a host that
 *   keeps no history simply reports an empty script.
 * - `flows/write-flow` takes the three files that come back and writes them
 *   through a {@link FlowStore.FlowStore}. When a `Registry` is in context it is
 *   refreshed afterwards. When that registry is also passed to `Agent.run`,
 *   a successful refresh makes the new model-invocable flow appear in
 *   `ctx.flows` on the next frame. Each frame journals its catalog for replay.
 *
 * The rules and the skeleton are the host's, because the file layout a saved
 * flow lands in is the host's. {@link bestPractices} and {@link flowTemplate}
 * are this repository's, and {@link Options} is how a host with its own
 * conventions teaches those instead.
