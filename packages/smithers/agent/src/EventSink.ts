/**
 * The host seam that watches one model-backed step while it runs.
 *
 * {@link module:Agent} exposes a `Stream<AgentEvent>`; {@link module:AgentAction}
 * consumes it to produce one decoded value. The sink receives each emitted
 * agent event while the overall step runs.
 *
 * With {@link module:FlowEngineLike}, model deltas arrive at the sealed model-call boundary,
 * after the provider stream settles. That adapter records the complete provider
 * stream before emitting its events. The sink does not report live provider
 * progress. A replay emits the recorded events again without calling the provider.
 *
 * The service is optional. `AgentAction` resolves it with
 * `Effect.serviceOption`, so a composition that provides none behaves exactly
 * as it did before this module existed, and providing one changes nothing
 * about the step's answer, its correction budget, or its failures.
 *
 * Observer sinks consume the public stream. The native durable sink sets
 * `atSource`: the controller awaits its checkpoint before advancing or
 * parking. Each checkpoint commits its bounded fact with its own durable
 * outcome, before the enclosing agent action can settle. Provider work stays
 * outside the checkpoint's SQL transaction.
