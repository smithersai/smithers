/**
 * Where a saved flow's files land.
 *
 * A model that promotes the script it just ran produces three ordinary files —
 * the flow, its end-to-end test, and the fixture that test replays — and they
 * have to be written somewhere the next run can discover them. That "somewhere"
 * is not one thing: a checkout writes into the working tree, a browser host
 * writes into session storage it owns, and a test writes into a map it can
 * inspect. This module is the one contract all three satisfy, so
 * `PromoteFlows` never learns which one it is talking to.
 *
 * The store is also the last place an id is still just text. Every path a write
 * builds comes from it, so {@link validateId} runs before any of them are built
 * rather than after: `../escape` is refused as a bad id, not caught as a
 * surprising write outside the root.
