/**
 * Running one cell call against a pinned tree instead of the live one.
 *
 * `@smthrs/harness` decides *whether* a call may name a checkpoint: it mints
 * the handle, bounds how many a run may hold, refuses a mutating flow at one,
 * and folds the checkpoint into the call's key so a reading of the pinned tree
 * can never replay as a reading of the live one. Nothing in it knows what a
 * tree is. This is the other half — the decorator that takes a call carrying an
 * `at`, asks the store for that tree as a directory, points the call at it, and
 * gives the directory back when the call ends.
 *
 * It is a {@link FlowEngineLike.CallRunner} decorator rather than an option on
 * the runner, for the reason {@link FlowEngineLike.sandboxed} is one: it
 * composes with whatever else the host has wrapped its calls in.
 *
 * A composition that pins nothing is still wrapped, by {@link unpinned}. A call
 * carrying an `at` must never simply run there: it would read the live tree
 * while the cell believed it was reading a pinned one, and a fails-before proof
 * built on that reading would be a proof of nothing.
 *
 * A relocated call reaches the pinned tree and nothing else. That is not a
 * property of the flows being careful — it is a property of where they are
 * pointed: a shell call runs inside the detached worktree, so even a write it
 * never declared lands in the scratch checkout, which is removed when the call
 * ends; and a reader whose path climbs out of that checkout with `..` is
 * refused by {@link outside} rather than rewritten, because such a path is the
 * live tree under another name. The declared-write refusal in the controller is
 * the honest half of the same rule, stated where the model can read it.
 *
 * The one thing this cannot promise is a shell command that names an absolute
 * path or its own `..` inside the command text. A checkpoint is where a call
 * runs, not a sandbox, and `bash` may write anywhere the run can write with or
 * without one. Confinement is `WorkspaceSandbox`'s job and it composes
 * independently.
 *
 * Governing design: the "Checkpoints and worktree lanes" row of
 * The release policy, which defines an rc.0 checkpoint
 * as a pinned git tree per cell call, and the `@smthrs/std` `Checkpoints`
 * module that mints and stores those trees.
