/**
 * Teaches an agent Smithers itself, as one ordinary cell plugin.
 *
 * The plugin contributes through the two cell hooks that already exist:
 *
 * - `cellModelRequest` appends one short {@link brief} to every model request,
 *   so the agent knows what Smithers is before it has read a file.
 * - `cellFlows` adds `smithers.guide`, the structured {@link knowledge}, and,
 *   when the host passes {@link Ports}, `smithers.flows`, `smithers.run`, and
 *   `smithers.inspect` over the host's own flow-run control path.
 *
 * A cell reaches all of them the way it reaches every capability:
 * `ctx.call("smithers.guide", { topic: "cli" })`. There is no `ctx.smithers`
 * global and no second flow model; the host's run path keeps its own
 * persistence, deduplication, approval, and active-run limit.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0-rc.1
