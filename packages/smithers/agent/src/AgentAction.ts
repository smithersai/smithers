/**
 * The authoring surface for a model-backed step.
 *
 * `packages/smithers/flows/flow/src/Graph.ts` records the decision this module is built on:
 * the model-shaped `Dynamic` node did not come across, because **a model call
 * is an ordinary action**. That decision is right and it left a hole. The
 * runtime to run one already existed — {@link module:Agent} assembles the whole
 * cell loop and returns its `Stream<AgentEvent>` — but the only ways to reach it
 * were a markdown flow run whole by {@link module:AgentSession}, where the agent
 * *is* the flow, or a hand-registered flow body at a composition root. Neither
 * is something a workflow author can write as one step among other steps.
 *
 * {@link make} is that missing constructor. It declares an ordinary
 * `Action` — same tag, same payload schema, same `.call()`, same plan node,
 * same durable replay — and ships the implementation with it: seat, system
 * teaching, a prompt built from the step payload, and a declared output schema
 * that the answer must satisfy. Nothing about the graph changes; what changes
 * is that the author no longer supplies the implementation, because a model
 * call has exactly one.
 *
 * Structured output is enforced at this boundary by
 * `@smthrs/harness/StructuredOutput`, whose own module documentation states
 * the recovery contract: the declared schema is rendered
 * into the run's system teaching, the final `complete` transition's `output` is
 * decoded by it, and a decode miss spends a correction slot on a re-prompt
 * before it becomes a typed `StructuredOutputFailure`.
 *
 * The host half is two services. {@link Host} carries the registry, the sandbox
 * budget, and the catalog every model-backed action in a composition shares;
 * `SeatResolver` turns the declared seat string into a live model. An author's
 * declaration therefore names no model credentials and no host wiring, and a
 * test swaps the whole model for a scripted one by providing a different
 * `SeatResolver`.
 *
 * Reference consulted: `reference/effect`
 * `packages/effect/src/unstable/ai/LanguageModel.ts` (`generateObject`) for the
 * declare-schema / decode-with-typed-failure shape, and `reference/opencode`
 * `packages/llm` for keeping provider resolution behind a host-supplied seam
 * rather than in the authoring call. Deviation from effect: `generateObject`
 * sends the schema as a provider `responseFormat`; `@smthrs/model` has no such
 * request field and the cell loop's answer is a `Cell.Complete` string, so the
 * schema travels in the prompt and is enforced locally.
 *
