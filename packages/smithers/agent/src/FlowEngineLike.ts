/**
 * The production `EngineLike` binding: the harness engine port executed on the
 * durable flow engine from `@smthrs/engine`.
 *
 * `@smthrs/harness` declares the port (`sealStep` / `splice` / `suspend`) and
 * ships only `layer(implementation)` and `layerNoop`. This module supplies the
 * missing implementation, so a production consumer can run the harness on the
 * durable engine without reaching into `@smthrs/testing`.
 *
 * The binding is deliberately *not* `@smthrs/testing`'s `FlowEngineLike`:
 * that module adapts the engine to `EngineSubject`
 * (`run` / `result` / `interrupt` / `resume` / `journal`), the conformance
 * contract used by the testing library. The two ports share a backing engine
 * and nothing else, and `packages/testing/test/EngineSubject.test.ts` asserts
 * they stay distinct.
 *
 * How the port maps onto the engine:
 *
 * - `sealStep` resolves the route, runs `Route.prepare`, and digests the
 *   credential-free `PreparedRequest` — canonical body bytes included —
 *   together with the harness's declared key material into a `StepKey`
 *   (`docs/pages/concepts/step-keys.md`). That key is the *sealed* activity's
 *   idempotency key, so a provider wire change produces a new key and a
 *   replayed turn re-emits the recorded model events without calling the
 *   provider again. Credentials are signed on by the route after the digest
 *   and never enter it.
 * - `splice` refuses every child in an elaborated batch with a typed engine
 *   failure. The elaborated-subgraph path was superseded by the cell loop, so
 *   the port remains available to the harness but does not run that old path.
 *   An empty batch still produces an empty stream.
 * - `record` journals one nondeterministic controller read — the steering
 *   drain, and the workspace measurements below — as its own run-scoped
 *   boundary, so a resumed run replays the recorded value instead of reading
 *   the world a second time.
 * - `observe` measures the workspace through `WorkspaceObservation.Observer`
 *   when the composition provides one, and reports it unobserved when it does
 *   not. This is what lets the controller decide "did this frame change
 *   anything" from the tree rather than from what the frame's calls declared —
 *   a shell command declares nothing and writes wherever it likes.
 * - Every key folds in the resolved composition identity `Options.layers` — the
 *   host's layer stack and its resolved plugin list. A boundary resolved under a
 *   different composition is a different boundary.
 * - `suspend` is a real durable suspension (`Flow.suspend`), not a failure.
 *   The execution parks and can be resumed by the engine.
 *
 * Reference consulted: `reference/effect` `unstable/workflow` (Action /
 * Workflow / DurableDeferred) by way of the vendored fork in
 * `@smthrs/engine`, and `reference/temporal`'s activity-identity rules for
 * why a non-sealed invocation must carry a distinguishing key.
