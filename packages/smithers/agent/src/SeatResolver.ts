/**
 * The host seam that turns a declared seat string into a live model.
 *
 * A flow declares `model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5` and an action declares
 * `seat: "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5"`. Neither declaration carries an API
 * key, an endpoint, or a client, and that is the whole point: a declaration is
 * portable, so the credentialed half has to live somewhere the declaration
 * cannot reach. This service is that half. `@smthrs/cli`'s `NodeControl`
 * installs the resolver that reads keys from the environment; a test installs
 * one that answers with a scripted model and never touches the network.
 *
 * Because the resolver owns the seat vocabulary, a host is free to define its
 * own. The `provider:modelId` convention is what the Node resolver understands,
 * not a rule the agent enforces — a resolver that maps `reviewer` onto a
 * particular model is an ordinary implementation of this one method. The
 * returned seat retains `id: "reviewer"` and supplies the provider model id in
 * `modelId` for generation and compaction.
