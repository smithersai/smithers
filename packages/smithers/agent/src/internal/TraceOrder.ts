/**
 * Record types that take no ordinal in their frame.
 *
 * `AgentSession.traceIdentity` folds in an event's ordinal within its frame, so an
 * event type added in the MIDDLE of a frame moves every row after it: a run
 * journaled before the type existed and resumed after would re-derive its
 * whole recorded prefix one ordinal along, match none of it, and publish all
 * of it a second time. `AgentSession`'s `lateFields` cannot help, because nothing about
 * the rows that moved has changed except where they sit.
 *
 * These are therefore identified by what they say rather than by where
 * they sit, the way `prompt-rendered` is. Each carries its own coordinates in
 * its payload (`scope`, `frame`, and for a request `purpose` and `attempt`),
 * which no two records of one run share, and they are written at ordinal zero
 * without advancing the count the other rows are numbered by.
