 * A provider call is the one step in the loop that fails for reasons that have

 * repository lost twenty minutes of context to
 * `ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_SESSION: The session has been destroyed`, with the frame,
 * the run, and the workspace state all discarded.
 *
 * `call_timeout` joins them for a different reason. It is the caller's own
 * doing — the request was interrupted at the budget the controller armed — but
 * it is retryable for the same reason the other two are: nothing about the
 * task changed, and the next attempt can succeed. What separates it is that
 * waiting alone would not help, so the re-issue also carries
 * {@link overrunTeaching} — and that it does not get this set's whole retry
 * budget, because it is the one code whose every attempt costs a full wall
 * clock ceiling rather than a refused connection. {@link defaultModelOverruns}
 * bounds it separately.
 *
 * Everything absent from this set is terminal for the request as written — a
 * bad key, a malformed request, a context overflow, a refusal — and retrying
 * one is pure latency. `context_overflow` in particular must reach the caller
 * unchanged: it is the typed signal compaction reads.

 * only after spending the whole armed ceiling, so five retries of it cost five
 * ceilings. On the wave 7 default of 300,000 ms that is a single sealed step
 * spending 1,800 s of wall clock — 150% of the 1,200 s process budget that

 * answer, so the only thing a re-issue adds is {@link overrunTeaching}, and a

 * shown the teaching did not land; a third ask costs another full ceiling and
 * buys nothing new. With one re-issue a step spends at most twice the armed
 * budget — 600 s at the default, under the 667 s single call that motivated

/**
 * Retries transient provider failures inside the sealed step.
 *
 * The retry is deliberately here rather than on the action's `retryPolicy`.
 * The engine's policy classifies by error *tag*, and every provider failure
 * shares the one `flows/model/ModelError` tag, so a tag-level policy either
 * retries a bad API key four times or retries nothing. It also replaces an
 * exhausted failure with `RetryAttemptsExhausted`, which would hide the very
 * `code` the caller branches on. Retrying in place keeps the classification
 * precise and lets the original typed error surface unchanged when the
 * backoff gives up.
 *
 * Each retry states the delay the schedule chose for it. The delay cannot be
 * read back off the journal timestamps: every retry of one sealed step is
 * buffered and written when the step settles, so a run that backed off for
 * half a minute and one that did not back off at all are indistinguishable
 * there.
 *
 * The classification is a `Schedule.while` *inside* the schedule rather than
 * `Effect.retry`'s `while` option, and the tap sits outside it. Both placements
 * matter. `Effect.retry` applies its `while` after stepping the schedule, so a
 * tap under it fires once for a terminal failure too and records a retry that
 * never happened — a `quota_exceeded` run journaled a phantom `model-retried`
 * exactly that way. Stopping the schedule first means the tap only ever sees a
 * step that will really recur, and `duration` is then the delay actually
 * slept — jitter and bound already applied — not the nominal one the base
 * schedule would have produced.
 *
 * `budgetMillis` is the same retry, applied to the one failure the provider
 * never reports: a call that answers, slowly, forever. It is enforced here
 * rather than around the whole sealed step so an overrun is an attempt rather
 * than the end of the frame — it is interrupted, classified `call_timeout`,
 * and re-issued on this schedule with {@link overrunTeaching} in front of it.
 * Interruption is the only mechanism involved: `Effect.timeoutOrElse` closes
 * the attempt's scope, and the model layer's own request teardown follows from
 * that, so nothing threads an abort signal and nothing polls a flag.
 *
 * The overrun rides the schedule's delays but not its count. Every other
 * retryable code fails fast and costs a backoff; an overrun costs a whole
 * armed ceiling, so it stops after {@link defaultModelOverruns} re-issues and
 * the step's total model time stays bounded by twice the budget rather than by
 * six times it.
 *
 * `onUsage` observes cumulative spend across this invocation's provider
 * attempts. The caller uses its last snapshot when no sealed value survives
 * (capacity refusal, permission failure, or interruption); partial text is
 * never exposed. The callback must be synchronous and cannot perform I/O.
