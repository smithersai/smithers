/**
 * Subagents, expressed as ordinary executable flows.
 *
 * There is no `ctx.spawn`, no `ctx.send`, and no `ctx.await`. A cell delegates
 * the way it does anything else: it finds a flow in `ctx.flows` and calls it.
 *
 * Two shapes cover the ground:
 *
 * - **Attached children** need nothing in this module. A dynamic flow (a
 *   `Flow.make` with a `model`) or a discovered markdown flow is already a
 *   subagent, and `ctx.call("review", { args })` already runs it inside its own
 *   durable boundary — `CellCalls` resolves the markdown body and hands it to
 *   the host's prompt runner, and `FlowEngineLike.call` keys the whole thing on
 *   the cell identity. That is the common case, and it needed no new API.
 * - **Detached children** — spawn now, collect later — need lifecycle
 *   operations, and those are ordinary flow *names*: `agent/spawn`,
 *   `agent/send`, `agent/await`. They are bound here through the same
 *   {@link FlowBinding} contract as a filesystem read, so they get the same
 *   `CellCallStarted` / `CellCallSettled` trail and the same replay identity.
 *
 * The lifecycle is behind a narrow injected {@link Children} port rather than
 * implemented here. Nothing in a browser-safe package can honestly claim to
 * persist a detached run, and pretending otherwise would produce a child that
 * silently restarts on resume; a host that has a durable run store supplies one,
 * and a host that does not gets {@link makeNoop}, whose refusal the cell can see
 * and route around.
