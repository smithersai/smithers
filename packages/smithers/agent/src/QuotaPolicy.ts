/**
 * Quota-aware waits: turning a provider's refusal into a deadline the run waits
 * out, rather than a failure that ends it.
 *
 * A `rate_limited` or `quota_exceeded` answer is not a defect report. It is the
 * provider telling the caller when to come back, and the difference matters to
 * every long run: a step that fails on a refusal loses everything the run had
 * done, while a step that waits keeps it and costs the operator nothing but
 * clock. Old smithers made that distinction with `classifyQuotaError` and a
 * `waiting-quota` park, and excluded a parked attempt from the retry budget on
 * the grounds that waiting for a window is not a failed attempt.
 *
 * This module is the classification half. It answers one question — "is this
 * refusal a wait, and until when?" — and nothing else: the park itself belongs
 * to `AgentAction`, which is the only place that knows it is inside a flow with
 * a durable clock to sleep on.
 *
 * Three things decide the deadline, in order of how much the provider actually
 * said:
 *
 * 1. `resetAtEpochMillis`, the instant the provider named;
 * 2. `retryAfterMillis`, the delay it named;
 * 3. a delay parsed out of the message text, for the providers that put it
 *    only there;
 * 4. and {@link Config.defaultWaitMillis}, when the refusal names nothing.
 *
 * {@link Config.maxWaitMillis} is the ceiling. Above it the classifier answers
 * `None` and the original `ModelError` propagates, because a run that parks for
 * a day is indistinguishable from a run that hung, and an operator who wants
 * that wait can declare it.
 *
 * The service is injected rather than assumed. A composition that wants every
 * refusal to stay a failure must say so explicitly with
 * {@link layerUnclassified}; omitting the decision is a type error.

 * and parked for twelve seconds, and `Retry after 12 days` parked for one.
