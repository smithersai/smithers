/**
 * What a run may spend across its model calls, and what happens when it has
 * spent it.
 *
 * Two ceilings already existed and neither is this one. `Sandbox.Limits` bounds
 * one cell's own execution, and `Agent.Options.maxFrames` bounds one loop's
 * turns. Both are per call. Nothing accumulated what a run had spent across its
 * steps, so `Envelope.budget` — the tokens and milliseconds a control plane
 * APPROVED for a plan — bound nothing at all: a plan could be admitted for a
 * thousand tokens and spend a million.
 *
 * Old smithers spelled this `<Aspects tokenBudget latencySlo>` and enforced it
 * at dispatch, from usage accumulated over the run. This is the same rule at
 * the same place: the enforcement point is the model boundary in
 * {@link module:FlowEngineLike}, which every model call in the composition
 * passes through, so a budget cannot be evaded by a step that assembles its own
 * loop.
 *
 * Its accounting and admission rules are:
 *
 * - **The accumulator is per run, keyed by the model step's content key, and
 *   projected from the journal.** Every call writes a {@link usageEvent}
 *   record and the run's first question writes a {@link budgetStartedEvent}
 *   record on the journal's DURABLE channel. A skip-remaining refusal writes a
 *   {@link budgetLatchedEvent} record there too. A budget entering a run folds
 *   all three back before it decides anything. This is what makes a budget survive
 *   a restart: the engine resumes a run from its recorded NODE results and
 *   never re-enters a settled step's body, so memory-only usage would hand a
 *   resumed run a second token allowance and a memory-only clock would re-arm
 *   its latency allowance. Keying by the content key is the other half: a
 *   replayed call and its own recovered record are the same key, so it counts
 *   once. Keying the accumulator itself by execution id is the third: one
 *   layer built at composition level serves every run the engine drives, and a
 *   single shared tally would spend run A's tokens out of run B's allowance.
 * - **The accounting fails closed.** A budget whose record could not be
 *   written, whose ledger could not be read or decoded, or whose ledger is
 *   longer than one recovery reads raises {@link AccountingUnavailable}
 *   instead of answering. Every one of those is a run that would come back
 *   from a restart with an allowance it has already spent, and the difference
 *   between a budget and a decoration is that it refuses rather than guesses.
 *   Only the {@link budgetWarningEvent} record is allowed to be lost: nothing
 *   reads it back, so losing one costs a line in an operator view and no
 *   decision.
 * - **Admission reserves a soft forecast.** Before dispatch, `reserve` counts
 *   actual spend plus all in-flight estimates, using the largest observed
 *   call. Before a positive cost is known, one call holds the whole allowance.
 *   Zero refuses new calls unless `warn` explicitly permits them. Scope exit
 *   releases reservations; recorded usage replaces the estimate. `check` only
 *   previews admission and must not be used as a concurrency guard.
 *
 * A forecast is not a provider billing cap: admitted calls may cost more than
 * estimated, including the first call. One shared Budget instance coordinates
 * concurrent calls of each run; independent instances are not a distributed
 * quota service. Durable execution ownership must prevent multiple hosts from
 * dispatching the same run concurrently.
 *
 * `onExceeded` is the composition's choice of what that means: `fail` reports a
 * typed {@link BudgetExceeded}, `warn` journals and proceeds, and
 * `skip-remaining` latches, so every later call in the run is refused without
 * asking a provider anything.
