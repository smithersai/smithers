 * sources and the generated module drift. Assembly is byte-stable — same
 * inputs, identical string — so the provider prompt-prefix cache hits
 * across turns. Design authority: https://chain.smithers.sh/contract/.
 *
 * The catalog block renders what the chain actually dispatches: names
 * dedupe last-wins exactly like `Catalog.make`'s lookup, an entry named
 * `author` is filtered (the trampoline intercepts that name before the
 * catalog), names are advertised byte-identically or omitted, and
 * descriptions are bounded JSON strings labelled as untrusted repository
 * data under the fixed contract rule. `forCatalog` assembles from a mounted
 * catalog service, keeping the advertised block and the dispatched entries
 * the same by construction.
