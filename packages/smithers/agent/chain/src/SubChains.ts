/**
 * Sub-agents as an ordinary catalog entry — recursion is the primitive.
 *
 * The `agent` entry runs a nested chain under a deterministic child id
 * derived from its call slot (`parent-chain/link.ordinal`), in the same
 * journal: the child's events are scoped by that id, so a re-executed
 * spawning call resumes the child from its own settled events — child
 * chains are incrementally durable for free. A child's `done` and
 * terminal parks settle as data the parent script inspects; a child
 * waiting on approval bubbles as an in-place park so a later grant
 * resumes the child through the same slot. Children run unattended —
 * the chain core never drains steering under a child scope
 * (https://chain.smithers.sh/contract/).
 *
 * Composition invariants: the catalog layer must be built over the SAME
 * journal/author/runner layers the chain runs on (the services are
 * captured at construction), root chain ids must not contain `/` or look
 * like `<digits>.<digits>`, and the reserved names (`agent`, `author`,
 * the system entries) may not appear in the host's entries. Invalid root
 * ids fail Chain.run with ChainError; reserved entries die at construction.
