 * Binds the memory package's own shipped contract — its input/output
 * schemas and `runRemember`/`runRecall` handlers — under the flows'
 * declared names. Payloads and results are held to those schemas, with
 * the actual parse failure quoted in every refusal; store failures carry
 * the memory package's stable error code as the call's `cause`
 * (https://chain.smithers.sh/contract/).
 *
 * Composition note: hosts that also mount the memory flows through the
 * registry must bind them there OR here, not both — a catalog holding two
 * `remember` declarations discloses one and runs the other, and journals
 * written under the registry's digest will refuse to resume against this
 * door's digest.
