description: "Every failure code @smthrs/evals raises, what it means, and who fixes it."

Failures arrive as `EvalError` values with a stable `code`, a `message`
written for a CI log, and usually a `path` locating the offending value. The
`code` is the branch point, and each code names one owner for the fix.

## invalid_suite

The suite declaration is wrong. The suite author fixes it.

## invalid_run_options

`Runner.run`'s own options are wrong, not the suite. The caller fixes them.

- `Deterministic runs require a non-empty runId`, at `options.runId`: pass a
  run identity.
- `Deterministic runs require a canonical UTC timestamp such as
  2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`, at `options.at`: the value must carry millisecond
  precision and round-trip through parse and re-render.
  `new Date().toISOString()` satisfies the format.

## invalid_baseline

The committed baseline is unreadable or belongs to another suite. Check the
artifact and its ownership before regenerating it from a green run.

- `Baseline is not valid JSON` or `Baseline must be an object`: the file is
  not a baseline artifact. These two carry no `path`.
- `Baseline version must be 1`, at `version`: the artifact was written by a
  different version of the format.
- `Baseline field 'suite' must be a string`, at `suite`: a present top-level
  `suite` has the wrong type.
- `Cannot infer baseline suite: legacy artifact has no records`, at `suite`:
  the version-1 artifact has neither a top-level `suite` nor records. Add the
  known owning suite explicitly, or regenerate it from that suite's green run.
- `Cannot infer baseline suite: legacy records name multiple suites`, at
  `suite`: records disagree on ownership. Recover a baseline for the intended
  suite; do not choose the first record's suite for a mixed artifact.
- `Baseline records must be an array`, at `records`.
- A record that is not an object, an identity field that is not a string or
  holds a control character, or a score outside [0, 1]: the record index and
  field are in `path`, as in `records[3].score`.
- `Baseline belongs to suite '<name>', but the run is suite '<name>'`, at
  `baseline.suite` or `baseline.records`: comparison loaded the wrong file.
  Check the path CI reads.

A suite-less version-1 artifact loads when its records are nonempty and all
name the same suite. `Baseline.write` of that loaded value adds the inferred
top-level `suite` and retains the existing scores.

## invalid_tolerance

A comparison tolerance is not a finite non-negative number, at
`tolerances.absolute` or `tolerances.relative`. Fix the call, not the
baseline.

## executor

The target flow failed for a case, or no executor was available.

- `Target failed for case '<name>': ...`: the executor failed. The run keeps
  the typed error, locates it with the executor's own `path` or with
  `cases['<name>']`, and produces no observations for the case. The rest of
  the suite still ran. Read the retained `cause`.
- `No executor is available for case '<name>'`: the run was provided
  `CaseExecutor.makeNoop()` or `CaseExecutor.layerNoop`. Wire a real executor.

## ambiguous_score_job

Two score jobs share a step key and a scorer, so an order-only batch runner
cannot attribute their results to a case. Give each case its own step key, or
provide a batch runner that implements `runBatchCorrelated`.

## scorer_protocol

A batch runner broke the `runBatch` or `runBatchCorrelated` contract: the
wrong number of results, a duplicate identity, an unknown identity, or an
observation that does not echo its job's `targetStepKey` and `scorerKey`.
Nothing it returned can be trusted. The message names the offending call, as
in `runBatchCorrelated[0]`. Compare the adapter against `Runner.makeInline()`,
the reference implementation of the protocol.

## scorer_unavailable

No batch runner was available to score with. This is `Runner.layerNoop`
working as declared: every bound score becomes an inconclusive observation,
and a gate grades the run undecidable rather than red. When the suite should
score, provide `Runner.layerInline` or a real adapter.

## Failures that are not EvalError

Two wiring mistakes fail outside the `EvalError` channel:

- `CaseExecutor.make` with no callback throws a `TypeError` synchronously.
  Pass a function, or an object with a `run` or `execute` callback.
- `Gate.check` with a threshold outside [0, 1] fails with a `ScoreGateError`,
  code `invalid_threshold`, from [@smthrs/scorers/ScoreGate](/api/scorers). Catch it in
  the error channel and report it.

## Symptoms

- Every score is inconclusive. Read the observation's `reason`. A
  `Scorer execution was inconclusive: ...` reason names a scorer or batch
  runner that failed. `<uncoercible cause>` means its failure could not be
  converted to text. Failure reasons use the scorers package's 1024-byte limit.
  A reason about a score outside [0, 1] or an unusable observation kind names a
  scorer that returned a bad result. A suite provided `Runner.layerNoop` also
  lands here.
- A binding graded nothing. The execution's `target` is not the exact flow
  value the binding's `appliesTo` holds (reference identity, not structure),
  the case failed before scoring, or the sampling policy decided against the
  execution.
- The gate exits 5. The gate could not decide, or it passed with unresolved
  observations. The Markdown report's Case failures, Missing observations, and
  Inconclusive sections name what is missing. Exit 5 is an unusable harness to
  repair, not a result to read.
- The report printed a secret. `Report.json` embeds each case's raw
  `execution.output` and redacts nothing. Keep the report out of readable logs
  when cases carry secrets.
