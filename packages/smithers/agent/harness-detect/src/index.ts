/**
 * `@smthrs/harness-detect` — which coding-agent CLIs this machine has, and
 * which account each one is signed into.
 *
 * Every host read is injected as a {@link HarnessHost}, so the table is a
 * pure function of a machine's files, environment and `--version` output.
 * The package spawns nothing and touches no filesystem itself: a runtime
 * adapter (Bun, Node, a test fixture) supplies the host.
