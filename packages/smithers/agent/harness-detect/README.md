# @smthrs/harness-detect

Which coding-agent CLIs this machine has, and which account each one is
signed into.

Given a host, the package answers one question for every harness id in the
`HARNESS_IDS` contract (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `kimi`, `opencode`,
`opencode-kimi`, `opencode-cerebras`, `crush`, `amp`, `cursor-agent`,
`hermes`, `pi`): is the binary installed, what version is it, is it signed
in, and how does it take a model on its command line. The answer is a
`Harness` row from `@smthrs/rpc/LocalApp` — the same shape the app's
`GET /api/harnesses` returns.

The package spawns nothing, reads no file, and knows no runtime. Every host
fact arrives through an injected `HarnessHost`, which is what makes the whole
table assertable over fixtures instead of over whatever happens to be
installed on the developer's laptop.
Path formatting and `PATH` separators follow `host.platform`.

## What it detects

- **The binary.** Explicit candidate dirs are searched before `PATH`, in
  order: `~/.local/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
  the nvm node dirs newest first, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.opencode/bin`. A Finder
  launch inherits the launchd `PATH`, which holds none of these, so the
  candidate dirs are not an optimization.
- **The version.** `<binary> --version`, delegated to the host, parsed with
  `parseVersionLine` — `"2.1.247 (Claude Code)"` is `2.1.247` and
  `"crush version v0.1.11"` is `0.1.11`.
- **The account.** Per vendor, off this user's own files: `~/.claude.json`'s
  `oauthAccount` then `.credentials.json`, the Codex `auth.json` `id_token`'s
  `email` claim (decoded, never verified, never returned), the OpenCode
  `auth.json` providers, and so on, with the vendor's API-key environment
  variable as the last signal. The status is one of `signed-in`, `api-key`,
  `binary-only`, `unavailable`.
- **The model flag.** `harnessModelSpec(id)` gives the binary and the flag
  that precedes a model id, and `harnessModels(id)` adds the verified
  suggestions and the argv that lists models. Every entry is read off the
  installed binary's own `--help`; a harness whose help names no model flag
  has no entry and never runs as a custom agent.

## The host interface

```ts
interface HarnessHost {
  readonly env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>
  readonly home: string
  readonly platform: string
  /** Entries of a directory, or [] when it does not exist. */
  readonly listDir: (dir: string) => ReadonlyArray<string>
  /** True for an existing regular file (a symlink to one counts). */
  readonly isFile: (path: string) => boolean
  /** File text, or null when it cannot be read. */
  readonly readText: (path: string) => string | null
  /** `<binary> --version`, or null when it fails or exceeds the host's timeout. */
  readonly version: (binary: string) => Promise<string | null>
}
```

Four reads and one probe. Nothing in the table reaches past them, so a test
host is a record of fixtures and a production host is thirty lines of
`node:fs`.

## Example

```ts
import { detectHarnessesWith, parseVersionLine, probeEnv, VERSION_TIMEOUT_MS } from "@smthrs/harness-detect"
import type { HarnessHost } from "@smthrs/harness-detect"
import { readdirSync, readFileSync, statSync } from "node:fs"
import { homedir } from "node:os"

const host: HarnessHost = {
  env: process.env,
  home: process.env.HOME ?? homedir(),
  platform: process.platform,
  listDir: (dir) => {
    try {
      return readdirSync(dir)
    } catch {
      return []
    }
  },
  isFile: (path) => {
    try {
      return statSync(path).isFile()
    } catch {
      return false
    }
  },
  readText: (path) => {
    try {
      return readFileSync(path, "utf8")
    } catch {
      return null
    }
  },
  version: async (binary) => {
    const child = Bun.spawn([binary, "--version"], {
      stdout: "pipe",
      stderr: "ignore",
      stdin: "ignore",
      timeout: VERSION_TIMEOUT_MS,
      killSignal: "SIGKILL",
      // The probe sees the allowlist and nothing else, so a session token
      // never reaches a CLI that is only reporting its version.
      env: probeEnv(process.env)
    })
    const [code, stdout] = await Promise.all([child.exited, new Response(child.stdout).text()])
    return code === 0 ? parseVersionLine(stdout) : null
  }
}

for (const harness of await detectHarnessesWith(host)) {
  console.log(harness.id, harness.status, harness.version ?? "-")
}
```

The live adapter is `apps/app/src/bun/Harnesses.ts`, which adds a per-binary
version cache and runs each probe under the app's seatbelt profile.

## Probe safety

`PROBE_ENV_KEYS` is the complete set of environment variables a probe child
may see, and `probeEnv` builds that environment plus `NO_COLOR`. Anything
else — `SMITHERS_CLOUD_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, an unrelated vendor key — is
dropped, because a process that only prints its version has no business
holding a session token. Sandboxing the probe is the adapter's job; the
allowlist is shared so every adapter drops the same things.
