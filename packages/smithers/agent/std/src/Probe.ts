/**
 * Telling an invalid probe from a failing check.
 *
 * A non-zero exit is a runner's verdict about the code it ran. It is not the
 * runner's verdict about the command it was handed. When an invocation names a
 * test, a file, a module, an environment, or a program that does not exist, the
 * runner never reaches any code and still exits non-zero — and at the tool
 * boundary that is indistinguishable from the bug reproducing. A SWE-bench run
 * lost thirty-nine frames to exactly that: the reproduction named a test method
 * the class does not define, so it read `exitCode: 1` before the edit and
 * `exitCode: 1` after it, and the agent could not tell it had already won.
 *
 * This module names that class. The taxonomy is one idea — *the invocation
 * named something that does not exist* — and {@link Reason} enumerates the five
 * things that something can be. An enumerated answer over prose is a judgment,
 * so Jev makes it: {@link classify} asks the `probe/attribution` classifier
 * whether this exit describes the tree or one of the five, and whether a runner
 * ran anything at all. Nothing here reads the output itself. The judgment used
 * to be nine regexes over runner wording, vetoed by two more over runner
 * tallies, and every phrase they matched is also printed by genuine failures —
 * a bug that *is* an import error, a test that asserts on a shell message — so
 * precision cost recall and both cost maintenance.
 *
 * Two things are still decided here, because they are facts rather than
 * readings. A zero exit is never classified: a command that ran is a command
 * that ran, whatever it printed. And {@link posix} reads the two exit codes
 * POSIX reserves for the shell's own refusal to start the command — 127 not
 * found, 126 found and not executable — which no runner reaches its own tests
 * and then reports. Neither costs a call.
 *
 * There is no third path. When the judge does not answer, {@link unjudged}
 * turns its failure into the caller's typed failure: a guess about whether a
 * reproduction reproduced is worth less than nothing, and the caller can say
 * that a result was not judged where it cannot say that a guess was wrong.
 *
 * A flow that can tell the difference reports it under the reserved output key
 * {@link key}. The harness reads that key off an otherwise opaque call result
 * and refuses to count such a result as evidence that anything about the tree
 * changed, which is what stops a broken probe from being cited as a
 * reproduction.
