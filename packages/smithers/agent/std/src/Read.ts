/**
 * Read flow declaration and portable handler.
 *
 * `content` is raw file text. It used to be rendered as `NNN\t<line>`, and that
 * rendering was the single most expensive tool defect measured on the 45-instance
 * SWE-bench trace program: an anchor copied out of a read carried the gutter, so
 * every `edit` built from a read missed, and every cell that wanted a literal
 * line had to strip the prefix in JavaScript first. Two instances (django-13346,
 * django-14351) spent whole frames writing string surgery against text the file
 * does not contain. Line numbers are facts about the page, so they are page
 * fields — `startLine` and `endLine` — and never bytes inside the text.
 *
 * Every line in `content` is a whole line: a page cut short by the byte budget
 * drops its trailing partial line rather than handing back a fragment that looks
 * like an anchor and is not one. CRLF lines retain their trailing CR; only
 * the page's final LF is omitted.
