/**
 * The host's route into a named container, as an injected transport.
 *
 * A task whose interpreter, dependencies, and test runner live in a container
 * makes every command a nested quoting problem: the agent writes
 * `docker exec c bash -lc 'cd /testbed && python - <<EOF … EOF'`, and one layer
 * of that stack eats a quote. The measured cost across the 45-instance program
 * was twelve failed probes, one instance's single most expensive frame
 * (astropy-8707, which produced a probe that never ran), and a class of failure
 * that turns from a broken probe into a broken *edit* the moment the same
 * quoting reaches a writing command.
 *
 * So the transport is the harness's, not the agent's. A caller names the
 * container and passes its program and payload as data; this service turns that
 * into the argv the host actually spawns. `docker` and `podman` share the CLI
 * {@link makeCommand} builds, and a host with a different route supplies its own
 * {@link make} rather than teaching the agent a new incantation.
 *
 * A host that has no container route provides {@link makeNoop}, whose refusal
 * says so plainly. Nothing here shells out on its own: it only decides an argv,
 * and `bash` spawns it through the same permission-aware spawner as everything
 * else.
