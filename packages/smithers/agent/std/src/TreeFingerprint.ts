/**
 * The identity of one directory tree, measured where the tree is.
 *
 * `@smthrs/agent/WorkspaceObservation` measures the host workspace around
 * every frame so the loop's mutation accounting is a fact rather than a
 * claim. A command routed into a container writes to a filesystem that walk
 * never sees: the SWE-bench rig bind-mounts the checkout into its container,
 * so a container edit lands on the host too, but a container Harbor or Pier
 * starts has no such mount, and every edit an agent made there read as an
 * idle frame. Measured 2026-09-22 on Terminal-Bench 4.0: `read_only_cap`
 * ended one run after twenty-four frames of container writes, and the claim
 * judge refused another's completion as "work this run never recorded".
 *
 * This module is the same measurement taken inside the container: one POSIX
 * shell script that lists every kept file under a directory with its size and
 * modification time, in sorted order, and prints one checksum of the listing.
 * `bash` runs it through the container transport before and after a
 * containerised command and reports whether the two answers differ under the
 * reserved {@link key}. The harness reads that key as a measured write, the
 * way it reads `invalidProbe` as a measured refusal.
 *
 * The same properties as the host walk, and the same stated limits:
 *
 * - **Identity, not content.** Size and mtime per file; a rewrite that
 *   restores both is invisible.
 * - **Pruning is the signal.** {@link defaultPrune} and
 *   {@link defaultIgnoreSuffixes} are the one list both measurements use, so
 *   a derived artifact the host walk skips is skipped here too.
 * - **A partial listing says so.** The listing stops at {@link maxPaths}, and
 *   a measurement that stopped there reports `complete: false`; `bash` then
 *   reports nothing rather than a guess.
 * - **Every tool it needs is POSIX or busybox.** `find -prune`, `stat -c`,
 *   `sort`, `head`, `cksum` and `grep -c` are in every Linux base image this
 *   has been run against, GNU and busybox alike. A container that lacks one
 *   answers with a non-zero exit, which is read as "unmeasured".
