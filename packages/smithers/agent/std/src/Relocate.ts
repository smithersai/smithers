/**
 * What can be pointed at a checkpoint, and what cannot.
 *
 * {@link relocate} is the closed answer, and it is the half of the checkpoint
 * feature that tracks the flows rather than git: it knows that `bash` carries
 * its working directory in `cwd` and that `read`, `ls`, `grep` and `glob` carry
 * their subject in `path`, `path`, `root` and `root`. `Checkpoints` changes when
 * git does; this changes when one of those five input shapes does, which is why
 * it is a module of its own. `Relocate.test.ts` decodes every rewritten input
 * with the flow's own `Input` schema, so a renamed field fails there rather than
 * silently relocating nothing.
 *
 * `bash` names *where it runs*, so it is relocated by its `cwd` — into the
 * checkpoint, and into the same subdirectory of it the call asked for, because a
 * check declared in `tests/` that silently ran at the top would come back
 * failing for a reason nobody chose. `read`, `ls`, `grep` and `glob` name *what
 * they touch* relative to the workspace root, so they are relocated by prefixing
 * that root — and only when the path they name stays inside the tree, because an
 * absolute path in these runs is a container path the host cannot rebase and a
 * `..` path is the live tree under another name. Every other flow answers
 * `checkpoint_unsupported` through the harness, including `test`, which already
 * has `against: "base"` for exactly this question and would otherwise have two
 * mechanisms that can disagree.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0

/**
 * The flows whose input names where they run or what they read, and the field

 *
 * A closed table rather than a per-flow hook, because the set is small and the
 * rule for admitting one is exact: the field has to name a location the whole
 * call is relative to. `bash` runs in a directory; the four readers resolve
 * their subject against the workspace root. Everything else — an edit, a patch,
 * a web fetch, a memory write — either names no location or writes, and both
 * are refused above this module.
 *
 * `test` is deliberately absent. It answers this exact question already, with
 * `against: "base"`, and a second mechanism pointed at the same tree is a way
 * for two answers to disagree.
