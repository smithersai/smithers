/**
 * The `test` flow: run the declared suite, and answer with the two facts.
 *
 * Two things this returns that a shell command cannot. First, a *reading*:
 * `{passed, failed}` parsed from the runner's own report, with the raw tail
 * kept for whatever the parse could not carry — a suite's answer is a number
 * and a list of names, not twenty kilobytes of stdout for a model to re-read.
 *
 * Second, `against: "base"`: the same selection also runs against the pristine
 * base commit in a scratch worktree, and the two failure sets are differenced
 * here. That is the whole of attribution, in one call. Without it, agents pay
 * for it in frames — sphinx-8721 spent fourteen frames because a pre-existing
 * failure was never baselined, sympy-13878 spent $0.90 on the same mistake, and
 * django-24970 spent three frames. The rule the harness teaches ("before
 * blaming your own edit, run the same command on the unmodified tree") is only
 * cheap when the tool can do it.
