/**
 * Pinned trees, and the scratch checkouts a call runs against.
 *
 * A checkpoint is a **value**: minting one changes nothing about the workspace,
 * and running a call against one leaves the live tree exactly as it stands.
 * That is the whole of what it buys. Before it existed, the only way a run
 * could answer "did this command fail before my change" was to undo the change
 * — and the journals price that exactly. On `sympy__sympy-13878` the r95repl
 * lane applied one byte-identical 4,789-character patch **five times**, four of
 * those applications preceded by `git checkout -- sympy/stats/crv_types.py`,
 * because a clean fails-before proof required reverting the very work it was
 * meant to prove.
 *
 * This module is the host half of `@smthrs/harness`'s `ctx.checkpoint()` and
 * `ctx.call(flow, input, { at })`. The harness owns the surface, the identity,
 * the bound and the refusals; nothing in it knows what a tree is. This owns the
 * two host operations that need one:
 *
 * - {@link Checkpoints.capture} records the working tree under an id, and
 * - {@link Checkpoints.materialize} gives that tree back as a directory for the
 *   length of one call.
 *
 * ## The git binding, and the container constraint it is shaped by
 *
 * {@link layerGit} records a checkpoint with `git stash create`, then names the
 * commit it prints in this repository's own git config rather than with a ref —
 * see {@link configSection} for why a ref would hand the agent its own edit back
 * as history. `stash create` is the one git command
 * that records the working tree and changes nothing else: it does not write the
 * repository's index, does not move the worktree, and does not touch the stash
 * ref. That matters more than it sounds. The agent runs `git` in this same
 * workspace and its own `git diff` is the run's evidence, so a capture that
 * staged into the real index would be the harness editing the evidence while
 * recording it. A tree with nothing to record prints nothing, and the
 * checkpoint is then `HEAD` — which is exactly what the tree is.
 *
 * Untracked files are not in the recorded tree, which matches how the rig
 * captures a patch: `capture-patch.sh` drops paths that did not exist when the
 * agent started, so a checkpoint holds what a patch would hold.
 *
 * The materialization is a detached worktree at `<root>/.flows-checkpoints/<id>-<lease>`
 * — **inside** the workspace, which looks wrong and is the only thing that
 * works. A benchmark check runs through `docker exec` inside `/testbed`, and
 * `/testbed` is a bind mount of the live workspace. A scratch checkout anywhere
 * else on the host is simply not visible to the container, so the call would run
 * against a path that does not exist. Placed under the workspace it is visible
 * at the same subpath under the mount, needs no second mount, and needs no
 * change to how the rig starts its container. `TestRun`'s `against: "base"`
 * reached the same conclusion first and this reuses its shape;
 * `evals/swebench/run-instance.sh` excludes the directory from patch capture for
 * the same reason it excludes `.flows-test-base`.
 *
 * The worktree is added and removed around **one call**, which is stricter than
 * the frame lifetime the design asks for and much simpler: there is no cache to
 * invalidate, no id to leak, and a checkpoint used by three calls pays three
 * checkouts rather than risking one stale directory. A run that reuses a
 * checkpoint across frames simply re-materializes it, because the ref is what
 * persists.
 *
 * ## What can be pointed at a checkpoint, and what cannot
 *
 * {@link relocate} is the closed answer, and `Relocate.ts` owns it. That half
 * knows the input shapes of `bash`, `read`, `ls`, `grep` and `glob`; this half
 * knows git. They change for different reasons, so they are different modules,
 * and {@link relocate} is re-exported here because the harness reaches the whole
 * feature through this one.

 * Config and **not a ref**, and that is the whole of the decision. A ref is

 * -S` searches it — so a checkpoint named by a ref would hand an agent a commit
 * containing its own edit and let it read that back as if it were upstream
 * work. That exact class cost the measured program real money before the rig
 * moved jj's store out of the workspace (`evals/swebench/run-instance.sh`:
 * django-13346 applied two of its own snapshots as a fake fix), and a ref here
 * would reintroduce it one wave later.
 *
 * The commit object itself is unreferenced. It stays alive for the life of the
 * run — nothing in a run prunes — and `git worktree add --detach <sha>` checks
 * one out perfectly well, which is measured in `CheckpointsFixture.test.ts`. So
 * the tree is reachable by id and no command that walks refs can reach it:
 * `git log`, `git log --all`, `git log -S` and `git show <ref>` all answer
 * exactly as they did before the capture.
 *
 * Two commands still see it, and both are measured rather than argued in
 * `CheckpointsFixture.test.ts`. `git fsck` reports it as a dangling commit,
 * because that is what an unreferenced commit is; and while a checkpoint is
 * checked out, `git log --all` includes the other worktree's detached `HEAD`,
 * because `--all` spans worktrees unless `--single-worktree` says otherwise.
 * Neither is reachable by a name that looks like project history, and the cell
 * contract's environment section says outright that a dangling commit is this
 * harness holding the agent's own tree — which is the half of the django-13346
 * lesson that a store cannot enforce.
