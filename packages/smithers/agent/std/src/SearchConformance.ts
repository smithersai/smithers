/**
 * A differential conformance kit for {@link Search} implementations.
 *
 * `Search` is a public extension seam: a host binds its own implementation and
 * every `grep` and `glob` call in the package goes through it. Two peers ship
 * here, and the contract they are held to used to live only in
 * `test/SearchConformance.test.ts` — a file `package.json` does not publish, so
 * a third-party peer had the seam and no way to prove it filled it. Worse, the
 * cases there are hand-picked: they pin the divergences somebody already
 * found. A literal `?` matched `fo` in one peer and `foo?` in the other for as
 * long as nobody thought to write that case down.
 *
 * This module is the other half. It generates a tree and a batch of calls from
 * a seed, runs them through two implementations, and reports every answer that
 * differs. Nothing here knows which peer is right: a divergence is the finding,
 * and the reference peer to compare against is the caller's choice —
 * `PortableSearch` is the obvious one, because it needs no external binary.
 *
 * The generator deliberately stays inside the ground both peers claim to
 * share: no symlinks, no unreadable directories, no CRLF, no NUL bytes, no
 * filename a shell would have to quote. Those are the cases the hand-written
 * table pins one by one, with an expected value that says which behaviour is
 * intended. A generator cannot say that; it can only say the two disagree.
