/**
 * What a test runner said, read out of what it printed.
 *
 * A suite's answer is two facts — how many passed, and which ones failed — and
 * a runner spends twenty to thirty kilobytes of stdout saying them. Paying a
 * model to read that is the expensive way to learn a number, and the measured
 * program shows what it costs: sixteen frames on sphinx-8721 existed because a
 * pre-existing failure was never isolated, and the failure *names* were in the
 * output all along.
 *
 * The parsers below recognise the report shapes the standard runners print.
 * Precision is the design constraint, exactly as in `Probe`: a reader claims a
 * complete report only when the runner printed an authoritative completion
 * statement and the observed outcomes agree with it. Pytest requires a tally,
 * TAP requires a plan with every planned outcome, and unittest requires its
 * `Ran` line plus an `OK` or `FAILED` summary. Incomplete captures still return
 * the outcomes they contain with `parsed: false`. A wrong failure set is worse
 * than no failure set, because attribution is built on it.
