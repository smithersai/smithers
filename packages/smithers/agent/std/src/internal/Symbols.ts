/**
 * The definition a line sits inside, read off the file's own shape.
 *
 * A search hit is a line number, and a line number is not a read window. Agents
 * guess one: `offset: line - 10, limit: 40`, which lands short (astropy-15569
 * missed `get_lookup` by one line and probed the wrong binding) or long (six
 * blind-offset reads on sympy-13878). The enclosing definition is the window the
 * hit actually belongs to, and for indentation- and brace-structured source it
 * is derivable from the text already in hand.
 *
 * This is a heuristic and reports only what it can see plainly: a declaration
 * keyword, a name, and the block that keyword opens. When the shape is not
 * plain — a match at top level, a language this table does not name, a
 * declaration split across lines — it answers `undefined` rather than guessing,
 * because a wrong window is worse than none.
