 * Match-centric grep results: the limit counts matches, and context rides

 *
 * A flat list of rows made `limit` a row budget, and a row budget can spend
 * itself on context and drop the match. That is not a display detail: on
 * astropy-7166 the clip dropped the match row twice and cost three frames of
 * guard-bailing, because the agent could see the lines around its hit and not
 * the hit. Ripgrep's own JSON groups by match for the same reason.
 *
 * Both peers group here rather than each in its own way, so the native and
 * in-process implementations cannot drift on what a limit means or on which
 * match owns a shared context line.
