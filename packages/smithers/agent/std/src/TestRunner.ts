 * so at setup. What the measured program shows is what happens when that fact
 * is not a *callable* thing: agents guess labels
 * (`management_commands.test_flush`, `tests/related_lookup`, `test_axis.py` —
 * none of which exist), and a guessed label costs a frame each time. Seven such
 * invocations are documented across the 45 instances.
 *
 * So the invocation is a declaration, not a parameter: a caller of the `test`
 * flow selects *which* tests, never *how* to run them.
