/**
 * Checkpoints over a real repository, a real git, and a real process.
 *
 * `Checkpoints.test.ts` pins the argv and the relocation table against a
 * scripted spawner. It cannot say whether the thing works, because the whole of
 * the thing is git and a bind mount: a commit recorded without disturbing the
 * index, a detached worktree checked out *inside* the tree under test, a command
 * run in it through the path a container would use, and the checkout removed
 * afterwards with the live edit still standing.
 *
 * The container is a double rather than docker, and the double is the point: it
 * resolves `/testbed/...` to the workspace exactly as a bind mount does, so a
 * test that passes here is a test that the subpath — and only the subpath — is
 * what makes a checkpoint reachable from inside the container.
