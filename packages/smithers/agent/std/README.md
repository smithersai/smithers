# @smthrs/std

This package declares `effect` as an exact
`4.0.0-rc.112` peer dependency. Keep the application on that version so
all Smithers packages share one Effect runtime.

**Documentation:** https://std.smithers.sh

The standard flows tool library for filesystem, search, HTTP, shell, and language-server work. Each callable tool is an ordinary `@smthrs/core` flow declaration with explicit capabilities and effects, plus an injectable handler where execution is host-owned.

```sh
npm install @smthrs/std@next
```

The package publishes release candidates to the `next` dist-tag.

## Public API

The root entry point exports these namespaces; each is also importable from `@smthrs/std/<Module>`.

```ts
import { Read } from "@smthrs/std"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const program = Read.run({ path: "/workspace/notes.md" }).pipe(
  Effect.map((result) => result.content)
)
// Provide the kernel FileSystem and Path layers in the host.
```

`Read.content` preserves source-line bytes, including trailing `\r` in CRLF files, and omits the page's final `\n`. Copy it unchanged into an edit anchor and retain the `\r` bytes in replacement text to keep CRLF endings.

`Manifest.flows` is the declaration registry, `Manifest.handlers` contains directly executable handlers, `Manifest.effectsFor` narrows a declaration for one decoded input, and `Manifest.readOnly` is the canonical read-only projection. `@smthrs/std/package.json` is also exported; `internal/*` and nested `*/index` subpaths are blocked.

The root entry point is Node-only: `NodeLanguageServer` pulls in `node:url`. The four subpaths `@smthrs/std/Grep`, `@smthrs/std/Glob`, `@smthrs/std/Search` and `@smthrs/std/PortableSearch` are browser-safe, because nothing any of them imports reaches a Node built-in.

## Child process environment

Commands started by `bash`, `shell_command`, `test`, and the package's internal
process helpers do not inherit the full Smithers process environment. They
receive only `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `TERM`, `TMPDIR`, and
`SHELL`, plus variables the caller explicitly declares. Credential-shaped
ambient names such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `GH_TOKEN` are
withheld; an explicitly declared name is intentional and is delivered even
when its name looks sensitive.

## Limits

Every limit is a display budget disclosed to the caller, never a silent cut. A capped result says so in its own output: `truncated`, `<stream>Truncated`, or a `notice` line naming what was shown and what there was. Rows named by prose are fixed in the package and not exported; the rest are the constants named.

Shell capture is bounded where it is read rather than after: a command that prints gigabytes costs the bound, not the whole of what it printed, and the `<stream>DroppedBytes` fields count what the process actually produced. Every caller-supplied command (`bash`, `test`, `shell_command`) passes a bound. The internal `git` plumbing calls behind `Checkpoints` and `TestRun`'s baseline do not, because a listing read for its content is useless with its head missing. Those fields and the `<stream>Truncated` flags beside them are a wire convention: [`@smthrs/harness`](https://harness.smithers.sh) reads them to refuse a later write of those exact bytes, so check the flag before writing captured output anywhere.

## Failures

Handlers keep ordinary outcomes in the success channel: a non-zero exit code, an empty match set and a 500 response are all values. `StdError` is reserved for failures a model must see as failures, and its `code` is a closed, stable list carried with the offending `path` where one exists.

| Code                       | Meaning                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `not_found`                | The named path or ref does not exist.                         |
| `not_a_file`               | A file operation was aimed at something that is not a file.   |
| `not_a_directory`          | A directory operation was aimed at something that is not one. |
| `is_directory`             | A read was aimed at a directory.                              |
| `binary_file`              | The bytes hold a NUL or are not valid UTF-8.                  |
| `offset_out_of_range`      | The requested page or line span is past the end.              |
| `invalid_pattern`          | The search pattern does not compile.                          |
| `invalid_input`            | The input is self-contradictory or names an unusable value.   |
| `no_match`                 | The edit anchor or patch context is not in the file.          |
| `not_modified`             | The write would leave the file exactly as it was.             |
| `outside_declared_reads`   | A hermetic path token is outside the declared read set.       |
| `outside_declared_writes`  | A hermetic path token is outside the declared write set.      |
| `command_failed`           | The process could not start, or a host operation failed.      |
| `request_failed`           | The HTTP or language-server request failed.                   |
| `timeout`                  | The call exceeded its wall-clock budget.                      |
| `rate_limited`             | Provider rate limit reached; back off before retrying.        |
| `provider_unavailable`     | No host bound the service this flow needs, or it refused.     |
| `unsupported`              | The service does not implement this query.                    |
| `unsupported_content_type` | The response is not a type this flow renders.                 |
| `response_too_large`       | The response exceeded the byte cap before decoding.           |

Six services are injected, and a flow whose service a host has not bound gets a `makeNoop` refusal rather than a silent success: `Search` for `grep` and `glob`, `Container` for a containerised `bash` or `test`, `TestRunner` for `test`, `Checkpoints` for agent-side pinning, `WebSearch` for `websearch`, and `LanguageServer` for `lsp`. Refusing loudly is the contract, because a flow that appears to work while doing nothing costs a model the frames it takes to notice.

`NativeSearch` and `PortableSearch` are two implementations of one contract. `SearchContract` exports the matcher both build on, so an external peer binding its own `Search` cannot drift on what a pattern means. `SearchConformance` is how a peer proves it: it generates a tree and a batch of calls from a seed, runs them through two implementations, and reports every answer that differs. It found two drifts between the peers shipped here, one in how `maxCount` interacts with context lines and one in how `ignoreCase` and `smartCase` combine.

## Hermetic mode is a pre-check, not a sandbox

`Bash` retains `mode: "hermetic"` as effect-contract vocabulary, but the handler is not an operating-system sandbox. It performs a fail-closed lexical pre-check of the explicit path tokens in the command against `reads` and `writes`, resolving every token and every declaration to a canonical absolute path before comparing, and treating each physical line of a script as its own command. It then starts an ordinary host shell process. Shell expansion, subprocess access, and paths computed at runtime are not observed, so the check bounds what a caller declared it would do rather than what the process can do. A host that needs confinement must supply a sandbox or access-reporting boundary; the lexical check alone cannot prove hermetic execution.
