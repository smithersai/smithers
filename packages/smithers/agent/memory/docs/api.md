description: "Every public export of @smthrs/memory: the two flows, the memory policy, the store contract, the recall bindings, and the failure codes."
---

This page covers the parts a flow author touches: the two callable flows, the memory policy that decides which namespace a flow tree reads and writes, and the store behaviors that are easy to get wrong. The [module reference](#module-reference) at the end lists every export; the sections before it explain how those exports behave.

## The two flows

`Flows.remember` writes one record into a bank. `Flows.recall` reads advisory rows out of named banks. Both are declarations: building a graph performs no memory I/O. `Flows.handlersFor(flow)` supplies the runtime bindings for one declaration. `Flows.runRemember` and `Flows.runRecall` are the same implementations callable directly, without a policy.

Each flow also carries an effect declaration, the claim a planner reads before it runs anything: the paths the flow touches, a `mode` (`expected` means these are the paths worth declaring, `hermetic` means these are all of them), an `onConflict` policy saying what to do about another writer of the same path, and a `tier` saying how reversible the effect is. Tiers order from `irreversible` through `compensable` to `sealed`, and a nested declaration may narrow along that order but never widen it. `Flows.rememberEffects` is `irreversible` because it writes; `Flows.recallEffects` is `sealed` because recall declares no writes, so recall nests inside any enclosing declaration without widening it. [Effect envelopes](/pkg/core/concepts/effects) in `@smthrs/core` covers the full grammar.

A bank name is the public spelling of a namespace. `Bank.parse` is the validating reader: it answers an `Effect` and rejects an empty or malformed bank with `invalid_namespace`. `Recall.namespaceForBank` is the unvalidated inverse kept for callers that already hold a well-formed bank, and `Recall.bankForNamespace` maps a namespace back. An unprefixed bank is flow-local; a prefix such as `flow-` or `global-` names an explicit lifetime. Because `bank` and `flow-bank` resolve to the same namespace, recall de-duplicates on the resolved namespace rather than on the bank string.

## Memory policies

A delegated plan generates work its author never named, so the memory settings that work runs under cannot be arguments threaded through every call. They are attached to the flow instead.

`WithMemory.Policy` has four fields:

| Field       | Values                     | Meaning                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `namespace` | a `Namespace`              | where memory this tree reads and writes lives |
| `recall`    | `"auto"`, `"none"`         | whether recall runs at all                    |
| `maxTokens` | integer                    | the budget recall answers within              |
| `retain`    | `"on-complete"`, `"never"` | whether writes are kept                       |

`WithMemory.withMemory(flow, policy)` returns a copy of `flow` carrying the policy, and gives the same policy to every flow that flow declares. The original is untouched. A nested flow that already carries a policy is replaced by this one, so the tree runs under exactly one policy and the inherited answer is predictable. The policy is decoded and frozen at that call, so an invalid policy fails there rather than at a SQL constraint, and mutating the object afterwards changes nothing.

Only a flow whose collaborators are data, one declared with `flows: [...]` and no body, carries children a decorator can rewrite. A flow with a body reaches its collaborators by calling them, and those calls are graph nodes rather than a list, so `WithMemory.children` returns nothing for one. `WithMemory.references` is the wider view: it includes registry names the runtime has not resolved to a flow yet, which a policy carries through untouched.

A policy is an annotation, and an annotation takes no part in flow identity. Applying one never changes the graph a flow plans, node for node.

### Reading a policy back

`Flows.runRecallFor(flow, input)` and `Flows.runRememberFor(flow, input)` read the policy, and `Flows.handlersFor(flow)` is the pair a host binds. The policy namespace is the only namespace these scoped handlers may read or write:

- `runRecallFor` fills an empty `banks` list with the policy bank. Every explicit bank must resolve to the policy namespace, matching both `kind` and `id`. A foreign bank fails the whole request with `invalid_namespace` before the recall service runs, including requests that mix allowed and foreign banks.
- `runRememberFor` resolves an empty bank to the policy namespace. An explicit foreign bank fails with `invalid_namespace` before the store runs.
- Equivalent spellings are allowed: `release-notes` and `flow-release-notes` both resolve to `{ kind: "flow", id: "release-notes" }`. There is no additional readable-bank list.
- `maxTokens` remains a default: the policy budget applies only when the caller omits it.

Two policy values short-circuit before bank validation or I/O:

- `recall: "none"` returns no rows and never reaches the recall service.
- `retain: "never"` drops the write. The caller still receives the key it asked for, and nothing reaches the store.

The boundary applies through `Flows.handlersFor` on a policy-carrying declaration, or through `runRecallFor` and `runRememberFor`. Bare handlers, direct `runRecall` / `runRemember` calls, recall services, and store methods do not enforce flow policies. Hosts must bind the scoped declarations for model-facing access.

```ts
import { Flows, WithMemory } from "@smthrs/memory"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const scoped = WithMemory.withMemory(Flows.recall, {
  namespace: { kind: "flow", id: "release-notes" },
  recall: "auto",
  maxTokens: 2048,
  retain: "on-complete"
})

const recalled = Effect.gen(function*() {
  return yield* Flows.runRecallFor(scoped, { banks: [], query: "changelog" })
})
```

### Binding a policy-carrying declaration

Bind the same declaration the caller will run. For delegated work that is the copy `withMemory` produced, not the bare export, so bind it through `handlersFor`:

```ts
import { FlowBinding } from "@smthrs/harness"

const bound = WithMemory.withMemory(Flows.recall, policy)
const binding = FlowBinding.make({ flow: bound, handler: Flows.handlersFor(bound).recall })
```

The copy keeps the declaration's input and output schemas, which is what makes that call compile: `FlowBinding.make` reads `flow.input` to type the handler. A flow held as `Flow.Any`, the existential a pattern passes around, stays `Flow.Any`.

Every handler takes exactly one argument, the decoded flow input, because `FlowBinding.make` types its handler as `(input, call)` and passes the `Call` in the second position. Run coordinates are bound instead, once, when the handler is built: `Flows.handlersFor(flow, { runId, nodeId, iteration })` records them on every fact its `remember` writes, and `Flows.runRememberWith(provenance)` is the same thing without a policy. A provenance parameter on the handler itself would receive the `Call` and persist it as the fact's provenance.

Binding `Flows.recall` with `Flows.runRecall` reaches the store with no namespace, no budget cap, and no way to honor `recall: "none"`.

## MemoryTrellis

`MemoryTrellis.make` is the delegation case. `Trellis.make` declares the topology a model-authored plan fits inside, and fills its leaf slots at run time, so a leaf cannot be handed a namespace at declaration time. `MemoryTrellis.make` applies one policy to the author, to the leaf, and to the memory flows those declare, then annotates the trellis itself.

It takes everything `Trellis.make` takes, plus `memory`. The `envelope` is the bound the authored plan is admitted under: `fuel` is the total number of leaf calls the plan may make, `depth` the nesting it may reach, and `fanout` the members any one group may hold.

```ts
import { MemoryTrellis } from "@smthrs/memory"

const trellis = MemoryTrellis.make({
  author: planner,
  leaf: worker,
  envelope: { fuel: 6, depth: 3, fanout: 3 },
  memory: {
    namespace: { kind: "flow", id: "release-notes" },
    recall: "auto",
    maxTokens: 2048,
    retain: "on-complete"
  }
})
```

The graph is the plain trellis graph, node for node. `MemoryTrellis.parts` returns the scoped author and leaf on their own, for a caller that drives the plan with `Trellis.run` rather than calling the declared flow: calling the originals instead loses the policy.

See the [`@smthrs/patterns` reference](/api/smithers-patterns) and its [delegation guide](/pkg/smithers-patterns/delegation) for the trellis itself.

## Store behaviors worth knowing

These are the answers that surprise callers most often.

- `listNotes` defaults `status` to `"accepted"`. Pending and rejected notes are hidden unless you ask for them by name or pass `"any"`.
- A message id is unique within its thread, not globally. The same id in two threads is two messages. A same-thread retry whose `role`, `text`, or `at` differs fails with `idempotency_conflict` and a path to the first field that differs.
- `appendMessage` creates a missing thread for you, in the `global` namespace under the id `history`. Call `createThread` first when the thread belongs somewhere else.
- `maxTokens` is a UTF-8 byte ceiling over the serialized result array, not a token count. Bytes conservatively bound tokens without committing the package to one model's tokenizer. `Source.Input.maxBytes` is a separate ceiling on the rendered snapshot text.
- `capRecallResults` drops rows with empty text before it fills the budget.
- Fact values are stored as JSON, so the value `getFact` returns is the value `JSON.stringify` produced: `NaN` and `Infinity` become `null`, `undefined`, function, and symbol members disappear, and sparse arrays collapse. The value is serialized once at API entry, and the stored JSON, the search text, the retained tags, and any vector projection all come from that one snapshot.
- `RecallKeyword` normalizes both query and row text to NFKC before matching. SQLite full text search does not, so the two bindings can disagree on compatibility-equivalent characters.
- The authoritative store writes no embedding vectors. Semantic projection is opt-in through `RecallSemantic.decorateStore`, and `RecallSemantic.recall` scans all eligible vectors in the selected banks under the requested model, retaining only its result budget.
- TTL garbage collection is complete: `Maintenance.ttlGc` removes the expired fact, its full text projection, and its vector rows in one transaction.

### Published ceilings

| Ceiling                              | Value  | Enforced at                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `Namespace.MAX_TAGS`                 | 16     | tag decode                    |
| `Namespace.MAX_TAG_GROUP_DEPTH`      | 8      | tag-group decode and matching |
| `Namespace.MAX_TAG_GROUP_NODES`      | 64     | tag-group decode and matching |
| `Recall.MAX_RECALL_BANKS`            | 16     | `Recall.Input` decode         |
| `Recall.MAX_RECALL_BANK_NAME_LENGTH` | 128    | `Recall.Input` decode         |
| `Recall.MAX_RECALL_QUERY_BYTES`      | 16,384 | `Recall.Input` decode         |
| `Recall.MAX_RECALL_TOKENS`           | 65,536 | `Recall.Input` and `Policy`   |
| `Recall.MAX_RECALL_TAG_GROUPS`       | 16     | `Recall.Input` decode         |

Each tag group is bounded on its own, and the group list is bounded too: every group is evaluated against every candidate row by every binding, so an unbounded list would multiply the per-group budget without limit.

### What a read limit counts

`searchRows.records` and `searchFts.records` optionally restrict the read to at most 64 exact `{ kind, id }` identities, while preserving namespace, TTL, status, supersession, and tag filtering. An empty array selects nothing. Each identity requires kind `fact` or `note` and a nonempty id.

`limit` on `listFacts`, `listNotes`, `listMessages`, `searchRows` and `searchFts` bounds the rows the caller receives, after every status, supersession and tag-group filter on the same input. It is not a bound on the rows the query examines, and a bounded read never under-fills while matching rows remain.

Statuses and supersession are answered in SQL. Tag groups are answered by `Namespace.matches`, the single source of truth for the five match modes, so a tag-filtered read walks the namespace in bounded pages until it has `limit` matches. Working-set memory stays proportional to one page, never to the namespace.

Note and fact pages continue from the last examined timestamp and id, preserving ascending ids within timestamp ties. Inserts or deletes before the cursor do not shift later pages. These reads are not snapshots; updates that move a fact across the cursor may affect results.

FTS rank pages share one transaction because BM25 depends on the corpus, and filtered FTS reads use 512-row pages. The SQLite transaction holds off writers until the scan finishes.

Use `tagGroups: [group]` for one tag predicate. Multiple groups are conjunctive; the singular `tagGroup` input is no longer supported.

## Failure codes

`MemoryError.code` is the stable machine-readable answer, and `MemoryError.path` points at the offending field when one exists. `invalid_argument` means the caller passed something wrong; `store` means the backend failed. They are never the same code.

| Code                    | Meaning                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `not_found`             | the addressed record does not exist                               |
| `fts_not_enabled`       | the namespace kind has not opted into full text search            |
| `invalid_namespace`     | a namespace or bank name is empty or malformed                    |
| `invalid_tag`           | a tag or tag group violates the vocabulary or a published ceiling |
| `invalid_argument`      | any other rejected argument, with a `path` to the field           |
| `supersede_conflict`    | a supersession request contradicts what is already stored         |
| `idempotency_conflict`  | different creation data on retry, or an existing summary id       |
| `compaction_conflict`   | a summarized source row disappeared or its payload changed        |
| `embedding_unavailable` | the embedding provider failed or answered an invalid batch        |
| `vector_model_mismatch` | a stored vector under the requested model has the wrong dimension |
| `store`                 | the backend failed                                                |

## Module reference

Every module is importable from the root as a namespace and from its own subpath; the tables use the subpath form. [Import surface](./surface.md) documents the exports map.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Provenance`           | `{ runId?, nodeId?, iteration? }`: explicit run coordinates attached to a write.                                                      |
| `Fact`                 | `{ namespace, key, value, tags?, ttlMs?, provenance, createdAtMs, updatedAtMs }`.                                                     |
| `PutFactInput`         | `{ namespace, key, value, tags?, ttlMs?, provenance }`; `value` is stored through a `JSON.stringify` round trip.                      |
| `GetFactInput`         | `{ namespace, key }`.                                                                                                                 |

| `Message`              | `{ threadId, id, role, text, at }`.                                                                                                   |
| `AppendMessageInput`   | `Message`: an idempotent append, with the id unique within its thread.                                                                |
| `ListMessagesInput`    | `{ threadId, limit?, cursor? }`.                                                                                                      |
| `MessageCursor`        | `{ at, id }`: a stable exclusive cursor for ordered pagination.                                                                       |
| `MessageStats`         | `{ messages, codePoints, bytes }`: one thread's size bounds; its JavaScript string length lies between `codePoints` and `bytes`.      |
| `GetNoteInput`         | `{ id }`.                                                                                                                             |
| `NoteStatus`           | schema and type: `"pending"`, `"accepted"`, `"rejected"`; the only mutable state on an append-only note.                              |
| `Note`                 | `{ namespace, id, text, tags, provenance, status, createdAtMs }`.                                                                     |
| `PutNoteInput`         | `{ namespace, id, text, tags, provenance, status?, supersedes? }`; `supersedes` persists in the same write transaction.               |
| `SetNoteStatusInput`   | `{ id, status }`.                                                                                                                     |
| `SupersedeInput`       | `{ supersederId, targetId }`.                                                                                                         |
| `NamespaceInput`       | `Namespace \| string`: a structured namespace or a bank name; explicit prefixes keep their lifetime, unprefixed banks are flow-local. |
| `StatusFilter`         | `NoteStatus \| "any" \| ReadonlyArray<NoteStatus>`.                                                                                   |
| `ListNotesInput`       | `{ namespace, prefix?, limit?, tagGroups?, status?, includeSuperseded? }`.                                                            |
| `SearchRow`            | `{ id, kind: "fact" \| "note", bank, namespace, key, text, tags, updatedAtMs, status? }`: the normalized row recall bindings consume. |
| `SearchRowsInput`      | `ListNotesInput` with a `limit` that counts merged fact and note rows passing every filter.                                           |
| `EnableFtsInput`       | `Namespace.Kind`.                                                                                                                     |
| `SearchFtsInput`       | `SearchRowsInput` plus `query`.                                                                                                       |
| `FtsRow`               | `SearchRow` plus `rank` (raw SQLite BM25) and `score`.                                                                                |
| `CompactMessagesInput` | `{ threadId, summary: Message, sourceMessages: ReadonlyArray<Message> }`.                                                             |

The service tag is `MemoryStore`, `Context.Service` tag `flows/memory/MemoryStore`. Every operation fails only with `MemoryError`:

| Operation            | Signature                                         | Behavior                                                                                                                                                |

| `putFact`            | `(PutFactInput) => Effect<void>`                  | Last-write-wins upsert. Each update restarts the TTL clock and refreshes the FTS projection.                                                            |
| `getFact`            | `(GetFactInput) => Effect<Fact \| undefined>`     | Answers the current fact, or `undefined` when it is missing or expired.                                                                                 |
| `deleteFact`         | `(GetFactInput) => Effect<boolean>`               | Deletes the fact with its FTS and vector rows; answers whether a row existed.                                                                           |
| `listFacts`          | `(ListFactsInput) => Effect<Fact[]>`              | Ordered by key, excluding expired facts; optional key `prefix` and `limit`.                                                                             |
| `listAllFacts`       | `Effect<Fact[]>`                                  | Every unexpired fact, ordered by namespace and key.                                                                                                     |
| `createThread`       | `(CreateThreadInput) => Effect<Thread>`           | Generates an id when omitted. Idempotent on identical creation data; a conflict fails `idempotency_conflict`.                                           |
| `getThread`          | `(GetThreadInput) => Effect<Thread \| undefined>` | Exact read by id.                                                                                                                                       |
| `listThreads`        | `(ListThreadsInput?) => Effect<Thread[]>`         | All threads, or one namespace's, ordered by creation.                                                                                                   |
| `deleteThread`       | `(DeleteThreadInput) => Effect<boolean>`          | Deletes the thread and all its messages.                                                                                                                |
| `appendMessage`      | `(AppendMessageInput) => Effect<void>`            | Creates a missing thread in the `global` namespace under the id `history`. An identical retry is a no-op; a differing one fails `idempotency_conflict`. |
| `listMessages`       | `(ListMessagesInput) => Effect<Message[]>`        | Ordered by `(at, id)`; paginate with the exclusive `cursor`.                                                                                            |
| `countMessages`      | `(ListMessagesInput) => Effect<number>`           | Counts one thread's messages.                                                                                                                           |
| `messageStats`       | `({ threadId }) => Effect<MessageStats>`          | One SQL aggregate: message count, summed code points, and summed stored bytes, without reading message bodies.                                          |
| `putNote`            | `(PutNoteInput) => Effect<Note>`                  | Append-only insert; `status` defaults to `accepted`. An identical re-put is a no-op; a differing one fails `supersede_conflict`.                        |
| `getNote`            | `(GetNoteInput) => Effect<Note \| undefined>`     | Exact read by globally unique id.                                                                                                                       |
| `setNoteStatus`      | `(SetNoteStatusInput) => Effect<void>`            | The status gate. An unknown id fails `not_found`.                                                                                                       |
| `supersede`          | `(SupersedeInput) => Effect<void>`                | Adds a supersession edge. Both notes must exist and share a namespace; violations fail `supersede_conflict`.                                            |
| `listNotes`          | `(ListNotesInput) => Effect<Note[]>`              | Authoritative note read; `status` defaults to `accepted`, superseded notes hide unless `includeSuperseded`.                                             |
| `enableFts`          | `(kind: EnableFtsInput) => Effect<void>`          | Lazily enables FTS5 for one namespace kind and backfills it once; a kind that is already enabled is left as is, so calling it on every boot is cheap.   |
| `searchFts`          | `(SearchFtsInput) => Effect<FtsRow[]>`            | Direct FTS5 recall, `limit` defaulting to 20. A disabled kind fails `fts_not_enabled`.                                                                  |
| `searchRows`         | `(SearchRowsInput) => Effect<SearchRow[]>`        | Merged newest-first facts and notes for recall bindings; a bounded read never under-fills.                                                              |
| `deleteExpiredFacts` | `Effect<number>`                                  | Deletes expired facts with their projections, in bounded chunks.                                                                                        |
| `listThreadIds`      | `Effect<string[]>`                                | Every thread id, ordered by creation.                                                                                                                   |
| `deleteMessages`     | `({ threadId, ids }) => Effect<number>`           | Deletes the named messages, in bounded chunks.                                                                                                          |
| `compactMessages`    | `(CompactMessagesInput) => Effect<number>`        | Inserts the summary and deletes the sources in one durable write. A summary id that already exists fails `idempotency_conflict`.                        |

`compactMessages` captures the full `sourceMessages` rows and verifies them inside the write transaction before inserting or deleting. Missing or changed sources fail with `compaction_conflict`. An existing summary id fails with `idempotency_conflict`, including identical retries.

| `make`      | `Effect<Service, MemoryError, Crypto.Crypto \| DurableWriter \| SqlClient>`    | Builds the SQL-backed service and applies the package's idempotent migrations.        |
| `makeNoop`  | `(overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Service`                                    | An unavailable stub: every operation fails `store`, optionally overridden per method. |
| `layerNoop` | `(overrides?: Partial<Service>) => Layer<MemoryStore>`                         | Provides the unavailable stub.                                                        |
| `layer`     | `Layer<MemoryStore, MemoryError, Crypto.Crypto \| DurableWriter \| SqlClient>` | Provides the authoritative SQL store over the SQL client and the durable writer.      |

| `MakeOptions` | interface               | Everything `Trellis.make` accepts plus `memory`, the policy the authored plan runs under.                   |
| `Parts`       | interface               | `{ author, leaf }`: the scoped flows to hold when you drive the plan yourself with `Trellis.run`.           |
| `parts`       | `(options) => Parts`    | Applies the policy to the author and the leaf without composing them.                                       |
| `make`        | `(options) => Flow.Any` | Declares a trellis whose author, leaves, and memory flows all run under one policy. The graph is unchanged. |

`MemoryStore.make` and `MemoryStore.layer` run these migrations automatically. A standalone store needs only its SQL client, durable writer, and Crypto service; the resulting database can be reopened by another process.

When memory shares a database with the engine or control plane, compose all required lower migration sets before building memory. The CLI's shared control database installs `TimeTravelMigrations.sets`, `ControlMigrations.set`, and `MemoryMigrations.set` together. The database migration ladder rejects adding a previously absent lower block after memory has advanced the ledger; it does not assume those tables already exist. The [memory tutorial](https://smithers.sh/docs/tutorials/memory/) shows that shared composition.
