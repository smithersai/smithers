/**
 * A Trellis whose generated work inherits one memory policy.
 *
 * `Trellis.make` declares the topology a model-authored plan fits inside. The
 * leaf slots that topology reserves are filled at run time, so the goals a leaf
 * runs are not known at declaration time and cannot each be handed a namespace.
 * The policy is attached to the flows instead: the author and the leaf carry it,
 * and so does every memory flow they declare, which is where the memory
 * bindings in `./Flows.ts` read it back from.
 *
 * An annotation takes no part in flow identity, so the graph a memory trellis
 * plans is the graph the plain trellis plans, node for node. See
 * https://memory.smithers.sh/reference/api/.
