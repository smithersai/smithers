/**
 * The typed hook surface: hook kinds, the hook entry shape, and the shared
 * kernel's base hook catalog.
 *
 * The public package contract is documented at
 * {@link https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/api/plugin}. The shared catalog is limited to
 * `config` and `configResolved`;
 * `@smthrs/agent` adds only `cellRegistry`, `cellFlows`, and
 * `cellModelRequest`. Durable-core lifecycle policy is not a hook catalog.
 *
 * `FlowsHooks` is **open for augmentation, closed for dispatch**: a host
 * declares its hooks with `declare module "@smthrs/plugin"`, supplies the
 * matching runtime catalog, and dispatches only that bounded set.
