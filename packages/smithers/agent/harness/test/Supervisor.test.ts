/**
 * The supervisor, driven through the loop that offers to it.
 *
 * Every case runs the real controller against a recorded model, a scripted
 * engine and a scripted evaluator; nothing reaches a network. The scripted
 * evaluator tells the two classifiers apart by their questions: a request
 * carrying `complete` is the completion brake, which every case answers
 * confidently so the run can finish, and a request carrying `thrashing` is
 * the supervisor, which each case scripts for itself. A request carrying
 * `unnecessary_0` is a relevance reading, which the recalled rows go through.
 *
 * The rule the cases pin: the loop never waits for the supervisor, the
 * supervisor is asked and answers off the hot path, a reading past its
 * threshold is delivered once at the next boundary and only when steering is
 * armed, a reading nobody could take nudges nothing and reports no level,
 * a replayed run re-delivers what it recorded without asking again, memory
 * is written only for what Jev accepted, and a recalled row is shown once
 * unless relevance withholds it.
 *
 * The steering source in the delivery cases WAITS for the supervisor to
 * settle before it drains. That is the test harness holding the boundary
 * open so the assertion is about what the boundary delivers rather than
 * about scheduler luck; the loop under test still never awaits the fiber,
 * which the first case proves with an evaluator that never answers.
