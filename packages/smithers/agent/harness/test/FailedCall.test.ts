/**
 * A completion written before the failure it follows existed.

 * A cell is authored blind: the whole program, `ctx.done` included, is written
 * before any call in it settles, and a failed call resolves `{ ok: false }`
 * instead of throwing. A cell that requests work and completes in one program
 * therefore claims the request succeeded whatever the request did. A TUI
 * coordinator did exactly this: `agent.delegate` failed with "Three workers
 * are active", the same cell's `ctx.done("Delegated the estimation system
 * design to codex astra.")` ran anyway, and the user was told work was running
 * that never started.
