# @smthrs/harness

Release candidate scope, host requirements and compatibility review are defined in the [library support policy](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/RELEASE_SUPPORT.md).

This package declares `effect` as an exact
`4.0.0-rc.115` peer dependency. Keep the application on that version so
all Smithers packages share one Effect runtime.

**Documentation:** https://harness.smithers.sh

An agent loop where the model writes JavaScript instead of calling tools. Each
turn the model emits a **cell**: a small program that runs in a sandbox the run
keeps open, and that reaches the outside world through exactly one function,
`ctx.call(flowName, input)`.

Scheduling, persistence, transport, and model execution stay behind explicit
service ports, so this package holds no scheduler, no database, and no provider
client.

## Availability

`@smthrs/harness` is not on npm at 1.0.0-rc.0. Its source lives in the
[smithers repository](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers), and
[Installation](https://harness.smithers.sh/installation/) covers how to depend
on it from a checkout, the runtimes it supports, and the `effect` version it
pins.

## A working example

This program opens a QuickJS realm, evaluates one cell that completes the run,
and prints the outcome. It runs on Node with no other setup.

```ts
import * as Cell from "@smthrs/harness/Cell"
import * as QuickJSSandbox from "@smthrs/harness/QuickJSSandbox"
import * as Sandbox from "@smthrs/harness/Sandbox"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const call: Sandbox.Handler = () => Effect.succeed(new Cell.CallResult({ outcome: "success", value: null }))

const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const sandbox = yield* QuickJSSandbox.make
  const realm = yield* sandbox.openRealm!({ flows: {} })
  const frame = yield* realm.evaluate({
    cell: Cell.source(`ctx.done("hello from the realm")`),
    frame: 0,
    call
  })
  return frame.outcome
})

const outcome = await Effect.runPromise(Effect.scoped(program))
console.log(outcome)
// { _tag: "settled", transition: { _tag: "complete", output: "hello from the realm" } }
```

## The cell loop

The primary loop is cell-first. A frame is `model -> generated cell -> realm evaluation -> individually durable flow calls -> next transition`: the model emits fenced `cell` blocks of JavaScript, they run as one program in a realm that outlives the frame and whose only effectful primitive is `ctx.call`, and the cell states its intent by calling: `ctx.done(output)` completes, `ctx.park(reason, message)` waits, and a cell that calls neither continues. `Sandbox.replTransition` turns that call into the `continue` / `complete` / `park` transition the journal records; nothing is returned and nothing is filed, because the realm is the memory and what a cell prints is what the next model turn reads. `CellTurn` is that controller; it decides continuation from the transition and the run's budgets, never from provider tool calls.

The production QuickJS binding never runs an unbounded cell. `Sandbox.defaultLimits` fills every ceiling a caller omits: 64 flow calls, 1,000 interpreter interrupt checks and a 30-second compute deadline per frame, a 900-second whole-evaluation backstop, a 120-second ceiling on any one flow call, and a 128 MiB memory budget. The memory budget is a **run** budget rather than a frame one, because the realm outlives its frames: `runtime.setMemoryLimit` does not count string data on the shipped build, so the panel probe weighs what the realm's own names hold and refuses a frame that opens over the ceiling before it runs. A caller may raise any individual ceiling explicitly; omitted ceilings retain their defaults, so a partial override cannot accidentally disable the others. `steps` and `timeMs` have typed floors (`Sandbox.minimumSteps`, `Sandbox.minimumTimeMs`), because a budget of zero interrupts the binding's own scaffolding rather than the cell.

The controller also keeps the script itself, for the one host that needs it. A frame throws its cell away once the realm has evaluated it, so a model that wants to turn the script it just ran into a saved flow has nothing to read back. `CellHistory` is where the source goes: the controller appends each cell as it executes it, before evaluation, so a cell that raised is still part of what the run ran. The service is optional (a host that offers no way to save a flow binds nothing and the controller records nothing), and `@smthrs/agent/PromoteFlows` is what reads it.

Every `ctx.call` inside a cell is its own keyed, journaled, permission-gated boundary at the tier the flow declares, so a cell is never one opaque activity. That is what makes a crash or a permission park mid-cell recoverable: the cell source re-executes from the top, boundaries that already settled replay their recorded values, and execution reaches the parked call deterministically.

One case is bounded rather than free: a call the `callMs` ceiling interrupted settled nowhere, so a re-executed frame issues it to the host again and is then handed the recorded timeout. The cell's branch is stable either way; what the run pays for twice is the interrupted call. [Durability](https://harness.smithers.sh/reference/api/#durability) says why the call cannot move inside the record that would suppress it.

## Flows are the only capability primitive

A cell is handed exactly one authority: `ctx.call(flowName, input)`. There is no `ctx.fs`, no `ctx.shell`, no `ctx.mcp`, no `ctx.spawn` / `ctx.send` / `ctx.await`. Standard host capabilities, incoming MCP tools, and subagents are all _ordinary flow declarations plus a binding_, so a cell reaches every one of them with the same two lines and every one of them settles through the same durable `EngineLike.call` boundary with the same `CellCallStarted` / `CellCallSettled` trail.

`FlowBinding` is that contract: `Binding` pairs a flow declaration with its handler, decoding cell input through the flow's input schema and validating the handler's output back into serializable JSON; `Source` produces bindings, possibly lazily; `Catalog` composes ordered sources and refuses two implementations under one name; and `FlowBinding.registry` discloses a catalog through an ordinary `Registry.Registry`, with file-discovered entries keeping precedence. A correctable failure (bad input, a flow that failed, unserializable output) becomes a `failure` `Cell.CallResult` the cell may catch; a permission requirement, an abort, or a suspension stays in the typed error channel where the cell can neither see nor swallow it.

`@smthrs/agent/Agent` is the assembled production entry point that composes all of this over the durable engine.

## Running an agent needs `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

The sixth brake on a completion asks Jev, TypeSafe's decision model, whether the claim the run wrote matches the evidence the run produced, through the `Evaluator` service of [`@smthrs/model`](https://model.smithers.sh). It never falls back. A completion nothing could judge fails the turn as `HarnessError` `completion_unjudged` carrying the reason, the way `read_only_cap` fails it, rather than standing unjudged: a brake that goes quiet when its model is down is a brake that is only there when it is not needed.

It never goes quiet either. Every completion with a claim is read, `claimCap` (3) is the number of frames the run is given to prove one, and a claim with no bounce left fails the turn as `claim_unproven` carrying both probabilities. The cap used to end the brake instead of the run, so the second claim stood unread: on a real seat a run bounced once re-claimed the identical sentence and finished `stop` on it while the served repository's own test exited 1.

So `Evaluator.Evaluator` is a required service of `CellTurn.run` and of `Agent.run` above it. Every host chooses a real or deliberately scripted judge at composition time. `Evaluator.layerFromEnvironment(process.env, "my host")` reads `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and refuses immediately when it is missing, empty or blank, before databases, sockets or processes open. A host missing a judge now fails to boot instead of failing every completion. This blocks a bad deployment loudly and immediately. A judge that later stops answering still ends the run as `completion_unjudged`; that disposition is unchanged. The five deterministic brakes run first, and a claim they bounced never reaches Jev.

An offline host binds `Evaluator.layerScripted` deliberately, dispatches by question id, and computes answers from the evidence. Constant approval disarms the brake. One evaluator serves all the host's classifiers; see the [whole-host scripted judge](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/flows/test/fixtures/scripted-judge.ts). `Evaluator.layerUnavailable()` remains an outage fixture for classifier tests, not a host default.

## Public API

The root entry point exports one namespace per module; each is also importable from `@smthrs/harness/<Module>`. `QuickJSSandbox` is deliberately _not_ re-exported from the root: it carries an embedded WebAssembly build, so it is imported from its own subpath by hosts that want it.

Every module and every export it publishes is listed in the
[module and export inventory](https://harness.smithers.sh/reference/).

`@smthrs/harness/QuickJSSandbox` exports `make` and `layer`: the QuickJS-WASM `Sandbox` binding, which runs the same single-file build on Node and in a browser and enforces the default ceilings above. It is also the one binding that offers `Sandbox.openRealm`, the persistent realm every run holds for its whole life ([Repl realm](https://harness.smithers.sh/concepts/#repl-realm)). It also exports `VariantService`, `Variant`, `layerVariantLive`, `layerVariant`, `makeWithVariant` and `layerWithVariant`, which are how a host names the build instead of taking the default; see below.

`@smthrs/harness/package.json` is also exported. `internal/*` and nested `*/index` subpaths are not public.

## Naming the QuickJS build

`make` and `layer` compile the single-file build from bytes, which is what Node and a browser want. Some runtimes forbid that. Cloudflare's workerd runs no WebAssembly it did not compile itself: `WebAssembly.compile` over bytes fails at runtime, and the only module a worker can instantiate is one its toolchain bundled and handed over as an import.

`QuickJSSandbox.Variant` is that seam. `layerVariantLive` provides the single-file default and `layerVariant(variant)` provides a build the host names; `layerWithVariant` and `makeWithVariant` are the sandbox over whichever one is in context. `@smthrs/agent/Agent` carries the same pair: `layerDefaults` is unchanged and `layerDefaultsWithVariant` takes the build from context.

A worker names its build with the `.wasm` module its bundler compiled:

```ts
import wasmfile from "@jitl/quickjs-wasmfile-release-sync"
import wasmModule from "@jitl/quickjs-wasmfile-release-sync/wasm"
import * as QuickJSSandbox from "@smthrs/harness/QuickJSSandbox"
import { Layer } from "effect"
import { newVariant } from "quickjs-emscripten-core"

const layer = QuickJSSandbox.layerWithVariant.pipe(
  Layer.provide(QuickJSSandbox.layerVariant(newVariant(wasmfile, { wasmModule })))
)
```

The full workerd setup, including the `wrangler` configuration a worker needs,
is in [Run on Cloudflare workerd](https://harness.smithers.sh/guides/workerd/).
