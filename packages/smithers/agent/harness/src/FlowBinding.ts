/**
 * The executable-flow binding contract.
 *
 * A cell's only authority is `ctx.call(flow, input)`, so *every* capability an
 * agent can reach — a standard filesystem flow, a memory flow, an incoming MCP
 * tool, a durable child agent — has to arrive as an ordinary flow declaration
 * plus the code that runs it. This module is the smallest contract that pairs
 * the two.
 *
 * Three types carry the whole idea:
 *
 * - a {@link Binding} is one flow declaration, its projected
 *   `Descriptor.FlowDescriptor`, and a runner that decodes cell input through
 *   the flow's input schema, executes the handler, and validates the handler's
 *   output back into serializable JSON;
 * - a {@link Source} produces bindings, possibly effectfully, so a lazily
 *   connected server or a plugin can contribute without being resolved at
 *   import time;
 * - a {@link Catalog} is the deterministic composition of sources, and it
 *   refuses duplicate executable names rather than letting one descriptor be
 *   dispatched to another implementation.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* a second registry. The descriptors a catalog
 * projects are ordinary `FlowDescriptor`s, and {@link registry} composes them
 * onto an existing `Registry.Registry` behind that same contract — with the
 * file-discovered entries winning, so discovery precedence is untouched.
 *
 * The failure split is the one `EngineLike.call` declares. A refusal the agent
 * could plausibly correct — malformed input, a flow that failed, output that is
 * not serializable — becomes a `failure` {@link Cell.CallResult} the cell
 * observes as a resolved `{ ok: false, error }` envelope. The cell branches on
 * `.ok === false` and `.error.code` to recover; ordinary failures do not throw.
 * Anything the cell must never swallow, such as a permission requirement, an
 * abort, or a suspension, stays in the typed error channel. An interruption
 * is never caught at all.
 *
 * Governing design: `../docs/concepts.md#durable-cell-loop` and
 * `../docs/concepts.md#flow-registry`.
