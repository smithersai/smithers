/**
 * The one way this package asks Jev a question.
 *
 * Every reading a control takes — the supervisor's, the completion brake's,
 * and every relevance, compaction, monitor and routing reading after them —
 * goes through here, so each is metered the same way and fails the same way.
 *
 * Two layers. {@link measured} asks through the bound `Evaluator` and keeps
 * what the classifier drops: the transport's usage, the provider's own
 * confidence, the state exactly as it was sent, and the wall-clock latency.
 * Its failure is the transport's own. {@link read} is the fail-closed layer
 * above it: a host with no `Evaluator` and a transport that could not answer
 * both fail as {@link Unjudged}, with a detail that is safe to journal. There
 * is no reading Jev did not make, and nothing here fills one in.
 *
 * {@link perItem} asks one set of questions about each of many items. Items
 * go in as few requests as fit {@link maxStateBytes}, in order, and a reading
 * is whole or it fails: one failed request fails every item, and partial
 * answers are never returned.
 *
 * {@link recorded} is how a reading taken inside a run is journaled: through
 * `EngineLike.record`, so a replayed frame is served what the first attempt
 * read and never asks again, with the `decision-settled` or
 * `decision-unjudged` rows {@link emitRecorded} journals beside it.
