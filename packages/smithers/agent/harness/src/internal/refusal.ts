/**
 * The one constructor for a refusal a cell observes as a resolved envelope.
 *
 * A failed call **resolves** with a `failure` `Cell.CallResult`; it does not
 * throw, and `Cell.callFailure` renders it as `{ ok: false, error }`. The shape
 * is fixed — `value` is always `null`, because a refusal has no value to hand
 * back — so every boundary that refuses a call builds it here rather than
 * repeating the literal. An absent `code` is left absent rather than written as
 * `undefined`: the encoded result is the durable wire contract used in sealed
 * keys, and it means {@link Cell.defaultCallFailureCode}.
 *
