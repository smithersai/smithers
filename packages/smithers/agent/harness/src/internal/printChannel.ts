/**
 * The print channel: how a REPL frame's `console.log` calls become the bytes
 * its successor reads.
 *
 * Two jobs live here, and both were priced off the `rerun-r95repl` lane rather
 * than chosen.
 *
 * Every number here is a count of UTF-8 bytes, which is what the frame bound
 * and the retention ceiling both mean by "bytes": the notices this module writes
 * carry a `…`, three bytes wide and one UTF-16 unit, and counting them in units
 * put a frame one byte over its own ceiling.
 *
 * **Sharing the frame budget.** Statements used to cap independently at 4 KiB
 * each, head-first, under a 16 KiB frame bound that almost nobody reached: 197
 * of the lane's 357 printing frames had a statement cut, 191 of those while the
 * frame bound sat mostly unspent, and 3.06 MB went to per-statement caps against
 * 6 frames that ever reached the frame one. Head-first is the part that cost
 * verdicts — `sympy__sympy-13878` fused one `console.log` of 38,928 bytes whose
 * head was a Python deprecation banner, so what it lost was the tail: the result
 * of a three-minute test suite the same frame had just paid for, and the `git
 * diff` that would have shown it the edit was already in the tree. It re-ran
 * that suite four frames later. So the statements of a frame share one budget,
 * each is elided from the middle, and no ceiling moves: 16 KiB was the most a
 * frame could deliver before and it is the most now.
 *
 * **Compacting a printed structure.** A result printed whole is mostly repeated
 * keys — a grep hit names `file`, `line`, `text` once per match — so an array of
 * records whose keys are identical is rendered as a table with the keys named
 * once. It is keyed on the shape and nothing else — this module knows no flow —
 * and at the floor it applies to, three rows and two columns, the table is
 * shorter than the JSON by construction, so the change can only take bytes off
 * the bill.

/**
 * How many UTF-8 bytes of one frame's whole print buffer reach the next model turn.
 *
 * This is the only ceiling on the channel. A frame's statements *share* it:
 * each is middle-elided to the share it is apportioned, and a statement short
 * of its share hands the remainder back to the statements that are over theirs.
 *
 * They used to cap independently at 4 KiB each, head-first, and the r95repl
 * lane priced that: 197 of its 357 printing frames had a statement cut, 191 of
 * them while this frame budget sat mostly unspent, and 3.06 MB went to
 * per-statement caps against 6 frames that ever reached this one. The
 * `sympy__sympy-13878` run fused one `console.log` of 38,928 bytes; it was
 * shown the first 4,096 and lost the tail, which held the result of a
 * three-minute test suite the frame had already paid for. It ran that suite
 * again four frames later. Sharing the budget shows that frame 16 KiB from both
 * ends instead of 4 KiB from the head, and moves no ceiling: 16 KiB was the
 * most a frame could ever deliver before, and it is the most now.
 *
 * Every elision is from the middle with the dropped byte count stated, because
 * the head and the tail of a log are where it identifies itself, and the notices
 * are reserved out of this budget before any of it is apportioned — so the
 * assembled buffer is bounded outright and nothing has to shorten it a second
 * time. Sized against the `recall` budget it replaces, and delivered once rather
 * than re-rendered every frame.
