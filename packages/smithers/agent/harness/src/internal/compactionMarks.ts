/**
 * What a compaction does with each old frame: keep it, squash it into the
 * summary, or remove it.
 *
 * {@link pins} fixes what must survive whatever Jev says: a summary is always
 * squashed, so a later summary extends it; steering and the person's messages
 * are kept, and so is the newest frame that ran each check still failing; a
 * frame that changed files is never removed; and the two halves of a tool
 * call and its result share one mark. {@link read} asks Jev two questions
 * about each segment, and {@link resolve} turns the answers into marks,
 * demoting the least-needed keeps until the kept frames fit the window.
 *
 * Marking is not compacting. The supervisor asks about each settled segment
 * off the loop's hot path, and the run stores each {@link Answer} in the
 * segment's {@link Facts}; nothing the model is sent changes. Only when the
 * budget forces a compaction are the pins taken and the stored answers
 * resolved, and a segment still unmarked then is asked about in that one
 * reading.
 *
 * Nothing here journals or compacts; the caller records the reading, and
 * journals `decision-unjudged` and squashes every frame when it fails.
