/**
 * The supervisor's seat beside the cell loop: a one-slot sliding queue the
 * loop offers to, a forked fiber that reads the newest snapshot, scores the
 * run's monitors, judges the rows it recalls and marks the transcript
 * segments not yet marked, and a mailbox the next turn boundary takes a
 * monitor's message, memory and marks from.
 *
 * The loop never awaits any of it. `offer` is a sliding enqueue and returns
 * at once; `take` is a `Ref` swap. Everything Jev is asked, and everything
 * that comes back, happens on the forked fiber. A run that ends with a
 * reading in flight gives it `Supervisor.closeGraceMs` to settle and journal
 * as the scope closes, and no longer: a reading still unanswered then is
 * interrupted and journaled `supervisor-unjudged` with reason `interrupted`,
 * so a Jev call that was made is never missing from the record. A snapshot
 * the fiber never took is dropped and journals nothing: nobody asked.
 *
 * The reading is taken through `EngineLike.record`, keyed on the session,
 * the frame and the cell digest, so a resumed run is handed the reading its
 * original attempt recorded and never asks Jev again. The reading records
 * each monitor's raw value and nothing about delivery: `Monitor.gate` runs at
 * the boundary that takes it, inside that boundary's own recorded drain and
 * against the ledger the run holds there, so streaks, cooldowns and limits
 * count every delivery before it, a replayed boundary delivers exactly what it
 * delivered the first time, and a mailbox left over from a replayed frame is
 * discarded as stale rather than delivered twice. The rows a run has been shown are the boundary's to know:
 * a row shown between the offer and the drain is dropped there, so no row is
 * delivered twice however the readings interleave. Marks name segments by
 * digest and are never stale: a boundary stores them whichever frame's
 * reading they came from, and the model is not sent them.
