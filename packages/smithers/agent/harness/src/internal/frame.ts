 * Every check this run has run, without its result.
 *
 * Read off the run's own durable check ledger, which is the same ledger
 * `UnresolvedFailure` and `NarrowedCheck` read and which already holds what
 * this needs: the call's input as a clipped label and whether it reported a
 * failing or a passing exit status. `NarrowedCheck.remember` keeps the newest
 * entry per subject, so this is "every distinct command this run ran, and what
 * it last reported", newest kept and bounded by
 * `CompletionClaim.checksRunLimit`.
 *
 * One filter: `failing || passing`. A read or a search reports no exit status,
 * and listing it would tell the question a command ran without telling it what
 * the command found. A reading taken against a checkpoint is not in this
 * ledger at all, by the ledger's own rule: it read a tree that is not this
 * workspace, and `account` files it under the sufficiency ledger instead.
 *
 * ## Why it does not filter on the tree, although every other reader does
 *
 * The ledger stamps each entry with its frame's closing workspace digest and
 * with `stable`, whether that stamp is the tree the check actually read, and
 * every deterministic brake reads both because each of them asks a question
 * about *this* tree. Filtering here the same way was written first and was
 * measured wrong on a live run: the bug was fixed, the repository's own test
 * passed at frame 7, the run completed at frame 8 having made no calls, and
 * the list went out empty, so a true sentence read 0.91 on `invented` and the
 * run died with the fix on disk. Asked with the list, the same claim reads
 * 0.40; asked with an empty one, 0.93.
 *
 * The cause is the host, not the ledger. A host that serves a
 * directory and keeps the run's own journal at `<directory>/.smithers`, which
 * `WorkspaceObservation.defaultPrune` does not prune, so the digest moves on
 * every frame with no call declaring a write. Every frame therefore reads as
 * an unattributed mutation, which stamps every check `stable: false` and
 * leaves every ledger entry one digest behind. A tree filter over that reports
 * "this run has checked nothing" about a run that checked twice.
 *
 * So this list is deliberately a weaker statement than the brakes above make.
 * It says what the run ran and what it reported, not that the reading still
 * holds over the tree being completed on. That is the statement the question
 * it feeds actually needs — whether a claim about a command's result is a
 * claim about a command this run ran — and staleness is owned by
 * `NarrowedCheck` and `UnresolvedFailure`, which do filter, and which run
 * first.

/**
 * Whether a `complete` transition stands, or which demand hands it back.
 *
 * The completion's own evidence, judged once per demand. A run gets exactly
 * one frame wrong for free — the last one — and five things can be wrong with
 * it, four of them read off measurements the controller already took, under
 * four caps:
 *
 * 1. `UnmovedTree`: the tree it is completing on is the tree it opened on, so
 *    there is no change for any evidence to be about;
 * 2. `UnresolvedFailure`: a check over this exact tree reported a failing exit
 *    status and the run answered it with a different reading of the same
 *    subject rather than with the check itself;
 * 3. `NarrowedCheck.find`: this frame's check repeats an earlier, broader one
 *    and adds conditions to it, run after a change the broader one never saw;
 * 4. `NarrowedCheck.findOnly`: the check this frame ended on is the run's only
 *    reading of what it names — nothing broader was ever taken, so there was
 *    no broader check for (3) to find — and it carries a condition the run
 *    itself added, one taught neither by the prefix this harness wrote nor by
 *    the run's own other checks.
 *
 * Demands 3 and 4 share one cap. They are two readings of one question —
 * whether the evidence covers what it looks like it covers — and a run that
 * answers either has answered the question; a second bounce would be the loop
 * asking it twice in different words.
 *
 * 5. `CompletionClaim`: the last brake and the only one that is not a
 *    measurement. The four above have said nothing, which means the tree
 *    moved, no check was stepped around, and whatever the run checked it
 *    checked whole — and none of that reads the sentence the run wrote. So
 *    the claim, the task, the tree fact, every check the run took over this
 *    tree and the verbatim result of the last one go to Jev, and a claim that
 *    reports a command or a result none of that records hands the frame back
 *    from a cap of its own. It is last because it is the only one
 *    that costs a request, and because a run one of the four already named
 *    has a demand to answer: asking a model to add a second one would hand
 *    the frame two questions. It never falls back: a completion Jev could
 *    not judge — no evaluator on the host, a refusal, a deadline, an answer
 *    that does not decode — fails the turn as `completion_unjudged` carrying
 *    the reason, the way `read_only_cap` ends a run, rather than standing.
 *    `Evaluator` is therefore a required service of this function and of
 *    every turn above it.
 *
 * The fifth is the one that is read on *every* completion, and the three
 * things below that take a demand away do not take the reading away. The
 * others are recomputable from the journal, so skipping them costs a grader
 * nothing and a skipped one lets a completion stand that the truth bar still
 * judges. This one is a sentence being checked against the record, it is what
 * the server banner and the operator docs promise happens to every completion,
 * and the run's answer is the product. So when there is no bounce left to
 * spend — the cap is used up, or none of the room below exists — a claim that
 * reports work the record does not record ends the run as `claim_unproven`
 * instead of standing. That is the shape `read_only_cap` already uses, and it
 * is the only shape that keeps the promise: a cap that stops at the bounce
 * means the second identical claim is accepted unread, which is what a live
 * run did.
 *
 * The verdict is narrower than the bounce, and that is the whole of what this
 * lane changed. A completion the brake merely finds thin is handed back once
 * and then stands; only a completion at `CompletionClaim.inventedAt` — a
 * sentence reporting a command or a result nothing in the run produced — is
 * refused. Arming the verdict on "is the task done" instead killed roughly one
 * honest run in four, including five question-shaped turns in a row and one
 * live CI dispatch whose planted bug was fixed. `CompletionClaim`'s header
 * carries the eighteen-state corpus that measured it.
 *
 * At most one is named, in that order, because they are in descending order of
 * how fundamental the missing thing is: there is nothing to check, then the
 * check said no, then the check said less than it looks like it said, then
 * nothing in the record matches what the run said it did. Naming two at once
 * would ask the run to answer a question it has not been given a frame for.
 *
 * The loop names what is missing and hands the frame back; it does not re-run
 * anything, and it does not judge the answer that comes back.
 *
 * Asking costs the run a frame it can answer in, so a demand is issued only
 * where that frame exists, and three separate things take it away (and leave
 * the claim brake reading anyway, as above):
 *
 * - the frame budget, which has no frame left to spend, and turning a
 *   completion into an exhausted budget would lose the run's answer to make a
 *   point about it;
 * - the read-only cap, which is the other budget that ends a run and ends it as
 *   a typed failure carrying nothing. A run that changed nothing is exactly the
 *   run `UnmovedTree` fires on, so a completion one frame short of twice the
 *   cap would be bounced, spend that frame reading, and die as `read_only_cap`
 *   with the answer it had already written discarded — a demand turning a
 *   finished run into a failure, which is the one outcome none of these may
 *   produce;
 * - a demand this run has already answered. Each demand ends by promising that
 *   what comes back next is the answer that stands, and three of them fire on
 *   one transition, so the frame written to answer one is never judged by the
 *   next. See `State.demandedFrame`.
