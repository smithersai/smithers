/**
 * The variables panel: what the realm holds, stated every frame.
 *
 * A run's memory is not a JSON document the cell filed — it is the set of names
 * the realm is holding, and the model can only act on what the prompt says about
 * them. This is what the prompt says.
 *
 * Every line is a name, its type, one *cheap* size, and when it was last bound.
 * Nothing here is serialized whole: a panel that stringified every global would
 * pay the heap for it every frame, and the value the model wants is already
 * under the name the panel prints.
 *
 * Freshness is derived from the cheap size, which is what makes the panel cost
 * nothing. A binding rewritten to a value of the same type and the same size —
 * a 40-character string replaced by a different 40-character string — reads as
 * unchanged and keeps its stamp. That bound is stated rather than hidden: the
 * panel is a roster, and the run's own prints are what say a value moved.
