/**
 * The cell contract.
 *
 * A Smithers frame is `model -> generated cell -> realm evaluation ->
 * individually durable flow calls -> next transition`. This module owns the
 * serializable half of that sentence: the cell source the model emits, the
 * transition the cell settled, the typed outcomes a cell may settle with, and
 * the identity carried by every flow call made inside one.
 *
 * Nothing here executes anything. Execution is `Sandbox`; durability is
 * `EngineLike.call`; the loop is `CellTurn`.
 *
 * A cell does not *return* its transition. The realm is a REPL that outlives
 * the cell, so a cell states its intent by calling `ctx.done` or `ctx.park` and
 * `Sandbox.replTransition` builds the value; there is no returned object to
 * decode.
 *
 * Governing design: `../docs/concepts.md#durable-cell-loop`,
 * `../docs/concepts.md#repl-realm` and
 * `../docs/concepts.md#agent-cell-context`.

 * without dispatching host work.
 *
 * Keeping only the *last* block is what this replaces, and the cost of that

 * as seven blocks in a single reply — recon, probe, edit-plus-diagnostics,
 * suite, rehydrate, guarded replay, completion — and the harness executed block
 * seven, the imagined completion, against a tree where blocks one through six
 * had never run. Empty patch, run over in two frames. Multi-block replies were
 * 2 of 91 replies in that wave: rare, and instance-deciding when they land.
 *
 * A byte-identical repeat of a block is dropped rather than concatenated. Both
 * multi-block replies in that wave are in the journals, and the second one is a
 * model that emitted the same block twice: joining the duplicate would declare
 * its names twice and turn a frame that runs today into a `compile_failed`. A
 * repeat is the model restating one program, never a second step — a second
 * step that genuinely re-runs the same code would still have to differ
 * somewhere, if only in what it does with the result.
 *
 * Distinct blocks are joined as they were written, so a value bound in one is
 * bound for the ones after it. One program therefore means one set of
 * declarations, and two blocks that both declare the same name are a
 * `SyntaxError` the compiler reports — a durable observation the next frame can
 * fix, unlike silently running one block of seven, which is not observable at
 * all. The contract states the rule so a model that batches writes blocks that
 * compose, and `CellTurn` names the block count when such a program fails to
 * compile.
 *
 * The program is `typescript` when any block declared a typed fence, because
 * both bindings run TypeScript by erasing type-only syntax and erasure is
 * harmless to a plain-JavaScript block.
 *
 * Extraction reads text and never judges syntax. Whether the source uses module
