/**
 * The truncation ledger: which bytes this run was handed as a fragment.
 *
 * A flow that caps a captured stream returns the part that fit and declares the
 * cut in a sibling flag. What the cell reads is an ordinary string, and by the
 * time that string reaches a write there is nothing on it that remembers it was
 * cut — so an agent that restores a file with `git show <rev>:<path>` and writes
 * the captured stdout back replaces the file with its last 30,000 bytes. That is
 * not hypothetical: on a graded benchmark instance a 645-line module became its
 * own tail, the compile check failed with an indentation error, the run repeated
 * the identical restore without re-reading the flag, and the mangled file was
 * the answer submitted.
 *
 * The call boundary is the only place that sees both halves — the result that
 * declared the truncation, and the later input carrying those same bytes — so
 * the ledger lives there. A write of bytes a call already reported as truncated
 * is refused rather than warned about, because there is no case in which
 * writing a known fragment over a file is what the caller meant.
 *
 * The producing half is `@smthrs/std`: `Bash` declares `stdoutTruncated` beside
 * `stdout`, and the paged flows declare a bare `truncated` beside the text they
 * cut. Neither is a shared type — the controller must not depend on the tool
 * library — so both are read here as documented wire conventions, exactly as
 * `invalidProbe` is read by `CellTurn`.
