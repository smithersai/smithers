/**
 * Turning one agent's final text into a value the declared output schema
 * accepts, or into a typed failure.
 *
 * A model may answer with a bare JSON document, prose wrapped around a JSON
 * document, a fenced block, or JSON of the wrong shape. Downstream nodes must
 * never receive that ambiguity, so this module implements the recovery
 * contract in `../docs/concepts.md#structured-output`:
 *
 * 1. parse the complete, BOM-stripped response and decode it;
 * 2. otherwise scan once for balanced JSON containers, take the container
 *    whose matching close ends last, and decode that;
 * 3. otherwise report a typed {@link StructuredOutputFailure} carrying bounded
 *    diagnostics, which is what a caller re-prompts with when it still holds a
 *    correction slot.
 *
 * Every candidate is decoded by the declared schema. Extraction never relaxes
 * validation: it only decides which bytes are offered to it, and the schema may
 * accept any JSON root rather than silently requiring an object.
 *
 * The prompt half is {@link instructions}. It renders the declared schema as a
 * JSON Schema document placed in the run's system teaching, which is BAML's
 * `ctx.output_format` injection reached through the seam the vault note
 * specifies — the model is told the shape before it answers, and the answer is
 * still validated locally. Provider acceptance is not a cast.
 *
 * Reference consulted: the `generateObject` function from Effect's
 * `effect/unstable/ai/LanguageModel` module, which
 * sends `responseFormat: { type: "json", schema }` and then decodes the result
 * with the same schema, failing `AiError.InvalidOutputError` on mismatch. The
 * decode-and-fail-typed half is copied. The provider `responseFormat` half is
 * not reachable here: `@smthrs/model`'s `ModelRequest.GenerationParams` has no
 * response-format field, and the cell loop's final answer is a `Cell.Complete`
 * `output` string rather than a provider-decoded value, so the schema is
 * carried in the prompt and enforced at this boundary.
