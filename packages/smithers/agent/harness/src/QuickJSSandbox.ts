/**
 * The QuickJS-WASM sandbox binding.
 *
 * This is the production `Sandbox`: the cell runs inside a QuickJS interpreter
 * compiled to WebAssembly, which is a genuinely separate JavaScript realm with
 * no reference to the host's globals, prototypes, or module loader. The same
 * single-file variant runs unmodified on Node and in a browser, so a browser
 * host provides this layer and calls the identical harness.
 *
 * What the cell can reach is exactly `ctx`: `ctx.call` bridges to the host's
 * durable flow boundary, `ctx.flows` is a frozen catalog projection. The
 * prelude removes `Date` and `Math.random` from the realm, because a replayed
 * cell must reach the same calls in the same order, and `Proxy`, because a
 * value that answers reflection from a handler cannot be weighed against the
 * run's memory ceiling. There is no filesystem, no network, no process, and no
 * module loader to reach in the first place.
 *
 * Teardown is scope finalization and cancellation is fiber interruption: an
 * interrupted frame disposes the runtime, which is the only thing holding the
 * cell alive.
 *
 * Which QuickJS build is compiled is a seam. The default compiles the
 * single-file build from bytes, which is what Node and a browser want. A host
 * whose runtime forbids compiling WebAssembly from bytes at runtime, such as
 * Cloudflare's workerd, provides {@link Variant} instead and names a build
 * whose module came from its toolchain.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0

 *
 * The estimate covers array indices, enumerable own string-keyed properties,
 * Map keys and values, and Set values. It cannot see closure state, weak
 * collection entries, or other storage unreachable by those paths. Functions
 * have a fixed weight of 8 regardless of their scope. This supplements the
 * native allocator limit; it is not a hard bound on all retained memory.
 *
 * The returned function declares nothing on the global object and adds no name
 * of its own to the set it reports, because the host holds it as a handle rather
 * than as a global. Every value's *panel* line is measured cheaply — a string's
 * length, an array's length, an object's key count, a function's arity, a number
 * or boolean by value — because a panel that serialized every global would cost
 * the heap every frame, and the whole point of a realm is that the value is
 * still there under the name the panel prints.
 *
 * `bytes` is a second, separate reading and it exists because QuickJS's own
 * ceiling cannot supply it. Measured on the shipped variant: `str_count` and
 * `str_size` stay at zero for every construction a cell can reach — `repeat`,
 * `join`, and a string handed in by the host bridge alike — so
 * `runtime.setMemoryLimit` refuses one allocation larger than the whole ceiling
 * and never sees accumulation. A realm under a 128 MiB ceiling held 400 MiB of
 * live strings across forty frames and raised nothing while the host's resident
 * set grew by 385 MB. Under a per-cell realm that hole was bounded by one cell;
 * under a per-run realm it compounds for the life of the run, so the run budget
 * is measured here instead. See {@link openRealm}.

/**
 * Opens one QuickJS realm that lives for a whole run.
 *
 * The acquire/release is the pair the per-cell binding uses, moved up to the
 * caller's scope: teardown is still scope finalization and cancellation is still
 * fiber interruption, so nothing threads an abort signal. What changes is
 * lifetime — every cell is evaluated against the same context, so a top-level
 * declaration made in frame 3 is still bound in frame 9.
 *
 * Each cell is evaluated as `evalCode(text, "cell-<frame>.js", 128)`:
 * `JS_EVAL_TYPE_GLOBAL | JS_EVAL_FLAG_ASYNC`. That combination, measured on the
 * shipped variant, does three things at once — top-level `await` compiles, the
 * result is a promise the existing drive loop already knows how to poll, and
 * top-level declarations land in the realm rather than in an async wrapper that
 * dies with the frame. The raw numeric flag is passed because
 * `quickjs-emscripten-core`'s options object does not spell the async flag but
 * hands a numeric `options` straight through.
 *
 * The per-frame budgets survive the move unchanged, because they are counters
 * the interrupt handler reads rather than properties of the runtime: `timeMs`
 * and `steps` reset at each frame's start and the compute clock keeps refunding
 * host-call duration.
 *
 * `memoryBytes` becomes a **run** budget, and it is enforced in two places
 * because one of them cannot see half the heap. `runtime.setMemoryLimit` covers
 * the object graph and refuses any single allocation larger than the whole
 * ceiling; it does not count string data at all on the shipped variant, so
 * accumulation across frames escapes it entirely. The panel probe supplies that
 * half: it weighs what the realm's own names hold and a frame that opens over
 * the ceiling is refused before it runs, with the heaviest names stated, so the
 * next cell frees by assignment and the realm survives.
 *
 * The refusal is spent where it lands, and that is the load-bearing half of it.
 * Freeing is done by a cell, so a ceiling that stayed shut once it had fired
 * would refuse the freeing cell too, and the run would spend every remaining
 * frame being told to do the one thing it was being prevented from doing. So
 * the reading is cleared with the refusal: the next frame runs, the probe weighs
 * the realm again at its close, and a realm still over the ceiling is refused
 * again. The bound is therefore a pair of frames — a cell may allocate past the
 * ceiling and is told at the next frame, and a run that never frees alternates
 * between refusal and cell rather than growing every frame — which is what "the
 * names a run accumulates" can honestly mean when the harness never drops a
 * value behind the model's back.
