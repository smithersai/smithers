/**
 * Registry-backed resolution for the flow calls a cell makes.
 *
 * A cell's only authority is `ctx.call(flow, input)`, so every effect an agent
 * can reach is a registered flow. This module is where a call name becomes a
 * flow: it resolves the name against `@smthrs/registry` — the same registry
 * that discovered `flow.ts`, `flow.mdx`, and `SKILL.md` under the documented
 * precedence — and dispatches to the body the descriptor declares.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a second registry. Discovery, precedence, first-found
 * collision handling, and progressive disclosure all stay in
 * `@smthrs/registry`; this module only decides which body runs and turns
 * every resolution problem into a {@link Cell.CallResult} the cell can inspect.
 *
 * The split between a failed result and a failed effect is the contract
 * `EngineLike.call` declares. A refusal the agent could plausibly correct — an
 * unknown flow, a badly shaped input, a flow this host does not implement — is
 * a `failure` result, so the cell observes a resolved `{ ok: false, error }`
 * envelope and may recover by branching on `.ok === false` and `.error.code`.
 * Ordinary call failures do not throw. Anything the cell must never swallow,
 * such as a permission park or an abort, stays in the error channel of the
 * implementation that raised it.
 *
 * The resolver's shape is exactly `FlowEngineLike.CallRunner["run"]`, so a
 * durable host wires it in without this browser-safe package depending on the
 * engine binding.
 *
 * Governing design: `../docs/concepts.md#durable-cell-loop` and
 * `../docs/concepts.md#flow-registry`.
