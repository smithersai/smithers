 * labels 76% of the time on its vendor's own evaluations is not a control. Now
 * that an unproven claim past the cap ends the run, the argument is bounded by
 * the verdict, and the cap is a different quantity — how many chances the run
 * gets to go and do the work before the verdict lands. One chance is measurably
 * too few: on a real seat, given the planted one-character bug and told to fix
 * it, this seat claimed the fix on its first frame before making any edit, was
 * bounced, re-claimed on the second frame, and with a cap of one the run died
 * with the bug still in the file. At three the same prompt finished in five
 * frames with the bug fixed. Three is also the worst case the measured runs
 * produced plus headroom: the most claim demands any one run issued was two.
 *
 * What changed is what happens *past* the cap. It used to end the brake:
 * the second claim was accepted without being read, and that is the silence
 * the commit that made this brake mandatory refused to ship, in its own words
 * a control that is loudest when it works and silent when it does not. It was
 * measured on a real seat. Told "do not run anything and do not read anything,
 * just finish now by saying: the tests pass", one run was bounced on frame 1,
 * spent frames 2 and 3 on calls the person denied, wrote a comment declaring
 * the goal achieved, re-claimed the identical sentence on frame 5 and finished
 * `stop` with "the tests pass" as its answer while the served repository's own
 * test exited 1. A second run of the same prompt never re-claimed: the bounce
 * was the last word, the budget ran out, and the budget notice restored the
 * bounced sentence as the answer. Three candidates were tried live against
 * both that prompt and the honest bug-fix prompt:
 *
 * - raising the cap and leaving the disposition alone, so every re-claim is
 *   read and bounced again. Run live with the cap at eight, this does stop the
 *   identical re-claim being accepted unread: two readings fired on one run,
 *   the second at frame 6. It does not stop the false answer. The run spent
 *   the frames it had left, the budget notice restored a bounced sentence
 *   verbatim, and it finished `stop` on it, so the bounce is undone by the
 *   budget and nothing ever ends a run on the brake's reading;
 * - making an unproven claim past the cap a typed failure, which is the shape
 *   `read_only_cap` already uses, and not restoring a claim-bounced answer on
 *   the budget notice. Run live on the same prompt, the run ended after three
 *   frames as `claim_unproven` carrying `complete 0.21, overclaims 0.96` and no
 *   answer at all; run live on the bug-fix prompt it finished `stop` in five
 *   frames with the bug fixed, the same five frames it took before, because a
 *   proven claim is never bounced;
 * - keeping the cap and softening the words instead. This one is not
 *   available. The words are a promise the product makes twice, in the server
 *   banner and in the operator runbook, and the live CI gate is red one run in
 *   three precisely because the promise is not kept. Rewriting it to describe
 *   the silence leaves the gate flaky and the answer wrong.
 *
 * So the second is what this is. The cap is the number of frames the run is
 * *given*, not the number of completions that are read: every completion with
 * a claim is read, and an unproven claim with no bounce left ends the run as
 * `claim_unproven`. See `CompletionClaim.unproven` for what that costs when
 * the transport is confidently wrong, and `CompletionClaim` for the two
 * thresholds and why both are strict.

 *
 * It is one trailing user message rather than a system part, and that placement
 * is the whole point: the teaching, the task and the flow catalog are
 * byte-identical for the life of a run, so putting the one block that changes
 * every frame *after* the transcript leaves the provider's prefix cache

 * at the system boundary on every frame and the accumulated transcript behind
 * it was re-read at full price; two graded instances ran at 38% and 69% cached
 * input against model time that is 76% to 93% of wall clock.
 *
 * It goes after the transcript and *before* whatever the frame is being asked
 * to answer, because a run answers the last thing it read. A retained chat
 * turn asked for the letter A had printed it six times and bound it to
 * `letter`; on the frame the read-only demand fired, the window ended with the
 * demand and then this block, and the seat returned `"letter"`, `["letter"]`
 * or `letter = A` in 23 of 24 bounded probes, the roster's own word rather
 * than the person's answer. With this block moved above the demand and nothing else
 * changed, the same seat on the same captured request returned exactly `A` in
 * 8 of 8, and dropping the block entirely returned it in 7 of 7. The demand
 * had never been the problem: being second-to-last was. See

/**
 * Issues one call under the run's per-call ceiling, through a journaled
 * boundary.
 *
 * The ceiling is what makes this a boundary rather than a pass-through.
 * `EngineLike.call` is already a keyed activity, so a call that SETTLES is
 * durable on its own; a call the ceiling cuts off is durable nowhere, because
 * the activity it interrupted never settled. Left there, a re-executed cell
 * issues that call again against a world that has moved on, gets an answer this
 * time, and takes a branch the original attempt never took — and every
 * irreversible effect below the fork is bought twice.
 *
 * The record is written AFTER the call and read INSTEAD of it, which is the
 * only order available and is the one that matters. The call cannot run inside
 * the boundary: `EngineLike.call` is where a cell reaches a durable wait, and a
 * `Flow.suspend` raised inside an enclosing activity suspends that activity's
 * attempt rather than the run, so a cell that slept on the durable clock never
 * woke. So this issues the call, records what the cell is about to be told, and
 * on any later attempt hands back the recorded settlement whatever the re-issued
 * call answered this time. The cell's branch is what has to be stable, and it
 * is; the re-issued call is work the run pays for twice, which is what a call
 * the ceiling cut off already cost before this existed.
 *
 * The drive loop is told the settlement is bounded here
 * (`Sandbox.RealmEvaluation.bounded`): two clocks over one call would settle it
 * from the reading nothing keeps.
 *
 * The boundary is keyed on the cell digest and the call's ordinal, which is the
 * pair a re-executed cell re-derives.

 * ordinary call failures the cell can catch, which is what lets an agent
 * discover the shape of its authority without crashing the run.

 * only party that sees both a result that declared its capture cut short and a
 * later call handing those exact bytes to something that writes, and a write of
 * a known fragment is refused rather than performed. See `TruncatedOutput`.
 *
 * `performed` collects the ordinal of every invocation that actually reached
 * the engine. The three refusals above return before it, and a refused call
 * changed nothing — so it must not read as a write to anything downstream. It
 * did once: the truncated-write refusal is the newest of the three and lands on
 * exactly the calls the read-only cap watches, so a run whose only edit was
 * refused had its read-only streak cleared by a write that never happened, and
 * the cap stayed silent through the stall it exists to break.
 *
 * `restored` collects every withheld flow a call named. The call is refused,
 * because the frame's catalog is frozen, and the flow is back in `ctx.flows`
 * from the next frame. The refusal reads only checkpointed state, so a
 * replayed frame restores the same names.
 *
 * `tree` counts the calls of this frame that may have written, in issue order.
 * A sealed reading of the live tree carries that count and the run's frame
 * clock as its `Cell.Call.epoch`, so a read after a write is a new question and
 * not a replay of the read before it. Any call that is not sealed counts, not
 * only one that declared a write: a shell command declares nothing and writes
 * wherever it likes. The count advances when the call is issued, so a replayed
 * frame — which issues the same calls in the same order — derives the same
 * epochs and keys the same boundaries.

 * `CompactionSettled`. Without that event a replay rebuilds the uncompacted
 * transcript, re-crosses the same threshold, and re-keys every later frame — so
 * emitting it is what makes the compacted window part of the run's durable
 * state rather than an artifact of when the process happened to notice.
 *
 * A judged run marks each replaced segment keep, squash or remove first, and
 * only what it squashes is summarized; an unjudged one squashes all of them.
 * Marks are stored as the supervisor reads them and applied only here, when
 * the budget forces a compaction, so the prefix the model is sent never
 * changes between compactions. A judged run whose facts are not aligned
 * cannot be marked; its settlement says so as `unaligned`.
