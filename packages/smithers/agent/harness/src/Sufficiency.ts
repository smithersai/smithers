/**
 * The evidence that is already complete.
 *
 * Every armed control in this package pushes a run to do more. The read-only
 * cap says nothing has been written. The repeat demand says nothing new has
 * been learned. `UnmovedTree` says there is no change behind the completion,
 * `UnresolvedFailure` says a failing check was stepped around, `NarrowedCheck`
 * says the evidence is narrower than it looks. Five brakes and no accelerator,
 * and the asymmetry is not free: on a graded benchmark the best rounds pay one
 * frame re-checking work they had already proved and one more frame doing
 * nothing but writing the completion, because nothing ever tells a careful run
 * that it is finished. Two of the seventeen strokes those rounds spent over par
 * are that, measured.
 *
 * Pure braking also produces compliance rather than work. The wave that armed
 * the completion demands answered the read-only demand with a paragraph and no
 * write, and answered the unmoved-tree demand with "no change is needed" and an
 * empty patch. A control set that only ever says *not yet* teaches a run to
 * write the sentence that makes the notice go away.
 *
 * This is the counterweight, and it is built out of what the controller already
 * records. Three facts, in this order:
 *
 * 1. a check reported a failing exit status over a tree the run had not yet
 *    changed;
 * 2. the run changed the workspace after that;
 * 3. the same check, or a broader one, reported a passing exit status after the
 *    change.
 *
 * That is failing-before and passing-after over one subject, which is the whole
 * of what the contract asks a run to hold before it completes. So the harness
 * says so, once, in one sentence, and asks for nothing: the run may complete
 * citing it or name what is still missing. It is an observation and not a
 * demand — nothing is bounced, nothing is refused, no cap is spent — because a
 * harness that decided a run was finished would be grading the agent's work
 * with its own, which is the line every other control in this package holds.
 *
 * It reads no output and parses no runner. `exitCode` is the one wire key the
 * controller already reads, `UnresolvedFailure` owns what it means, and the
 * ordering comes from the run's own count of frames that changed the workspace.

 *    Checkpoint-attributed readings are already stamped stable by `CellTurn`;
 * 2. some remembered failure names the same flow and is the same call, or one
 *    that check is broader than, as `NarrowedCheck` `narrows` reads "broader":
 *    every term of the passing check is carried by the failing one, which added
 *    conditions to it.
 *    A broader reading passing is stronger evidence than the narrow one
 *    passing, never weaker, so it is admitted;
 * 3. the run changed the workspace between the two — the failure's epoch is
 *    below the epoch this frame closes at.
 *
 * The broadest qualifying passing check wins — fewest terms, the least
 * constrained question — so the sentence quotes the strongest evidence the run
 * holds rather than the first one found. Ties go to the earliest-settled check.
 * Among the failures that check answers, the most recent one wins, because it
