/**
 * The failing check a completion stepped around.
 *
 * `NarrowedCheck` names a completion whose last check is a *narrower* version
 * of one the run already ran, taken after the workspace moved. This module
 * names the case one step further along: the run's reading of some subject
 * reported a failure, over the very tree the run is now completing on, and the
 * run neither re-ran it nor left it alone — it took a *different* reading of the
 * same subject and completed on that one instead.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical. On a graded benchmark, one run edited a source file at
 * frame 11, ran `pytest -rA testing/python/collect.py` at frame 12 — the whole
 * file, unfiltered, over the tree it would go on to finish with — and was told
 * "2 failed, 72 passed". At frame 13 it ran a command naming four cases out of
 * that same file, was told "4 passed", and at frame 14 it completed. The broad
 * result was never re-run, never retracted, and never mentioned. Its graded
 * patch passed both target tests and 144 of 145 neighbours.
 *
 * ## Why a failing check alone is not the trigger
 *
 * "Some check failed and the run finished anyway" is not a defect, and reading
 * it as one would be the harness deciding whose failures matter. The same wave
 * contains the counter-example: an instance that **resolved** ran
 * `pytest -rA astropy/io/fits/tests/test_header.py` after its edit, was told "2
 * failed, 148 passed", and completed — correctly, because those two failures
 * were nothing to do with its change. Nothing in the record distinguishes those
 * two failure counts, and nothing may: counting failures means parsing a
 * runner's output, which makes this a rule about pytest instead of a rule about
 * evidence.
 *
 * What separates the two runs is what happened *after* the failing check. The
 * resolved run walked away from that subject entirely: no later call it made
 * names `astropy/io/fits/tests/test_header.py` at all. The unresolved run went
 * back to exactly the subject that had failed, asked a smaller question about
 * it, and reported the smaller answer. That is the shape this module names, and
 * it is one the run's own record establishes: the run itself demonstrated the
 * subject was still live by returning to it.
 *
 * So the demand is not "you have a failing test". It is: *the reading you
 * replaced reported a failure, and you replaced it rather than answering it.*
 * The run may answer either way — fix what the check reported, or complete again
 * saying why those failures are expected. The loop asks once and accepts what
 * comes back, because a harness that decided which failures counted would be
 * grading the agent's work with its own.

/**
 * Finds the failing check a completion replaced rather than answered.
 *
 * Every condition is read off something the harness already records:
 *
 * 1. the frame closed on a complete measurement, so a digest means something;
 * 2. some check in the ledger reported a failing exit status;
 * 3. that check was recorded over the tree this frame is completing on, so its
 *    result is a statement about the tree the completion stands on;
 * 4. it was recorded by a frame that changed nothing, so the digest stamped on
 *    it is the tree it actually ran over rather than a conservative guess;
 * 5. some *later* check {@link revisits} it.
 *
 * Condition 4 is the one that cannot be dropped. A frame's calls are not ordered
 * against its edits in anything the harness records, so a check taken in a frame
 * that also edited is stamped with that frame's closing digest — which reads a
 * check taken *before* the edit as though it ran after. `NarrowedCheck` accepts
 * that in the direction that suppresses demands; here the same stamp would
 * attribute a pre-edit failure to a tree the check never ran over, and invent
 * one. The same wave carries an instance where it would have: a reproduction run
 * in the same frame as the edit that fixed it, still reporting the bug.
 *
 * The ledger holds one entry per call signature, carrying that call's most
 * recent run, so "never re-ran it" needs no separate test: a check re-run and
 * passed is no longer failing, and a check re-run and failed again is still
 * unanswered. Ledger order is recency of last run, which is what makes
 * condition 5 a statement about time.
 *
 * The most recent such failing check wins, because it is the reading the
 * completion is standing closest to.
