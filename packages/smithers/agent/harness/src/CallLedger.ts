/**
 * The call ledger: what this run has already asked, rendered every frame.
 *
 * A cell's results are durable, but they are invisible to the next model turn
 * unless the cell that made them happened to copy them into `context`. A cell
 * is authored blind — the model writes the whole program before it sees any of
 * its results — so copying is a guess made before the answer exists, and the
 * rational response is to split one logical step across two frames: one frame
 * to fetch, one to look. Thirty-one percent of the frames in one graded wave
 * made no flow call at all, and the justifications they volunteered name the
 * cause outright: "loaded the durable investigation results so the next frame
 * can edit without repeating repository reads".
 *
 * This ledger removes the guess. Every settled call of the run contributes one
 * line the harness derives on its own — ordinal, flow, what the call was about,
 * whether it settled ok, and a structural digest of what came back — so a model
 * can see what it has already asked without asking again. It carries no
 * payloads: a line says `stdout=4096b`, never the four kilobytes.
 *
 * A call that *writes* gets two things more, because a repeated write is a
 * different failure from a repeated read. The line says so and says how many
 * bytes the call carried, and a write whose flow and input an earlier write
 * already settled names that earlier one. The r95repl lane is why:
 * `sympy__sympy-13878` applied one 4,789-byte patch five times across five
 * frames, reverting the file between each, and nothing in the run's own record
 * of itself said that the second application was the first one again. It spent
 * 649 seconds and $1.20, the slowest instance in an arm whose median was 121 s.
 * This is visibility and not a gate: re-applying is sometimes exactly right —
 * the run had genuinely reverted the tree — and the exact-match refusal the
 * truncated-write guard already carries is what stands between a run and a
 * destructive repeat.
 *
 * It is a sibling of `NarrowedCheck` and `TruncatedOutput`: run-scoped
 * controller state, bounded, journal-derivable, and interpreting nothing about
 * any flow, tool, or repository.
