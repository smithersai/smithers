/**
 * Declarative supervisor monitors: what one reading can put in front of the
 * run, and when.
 *
 * A monitor turns one {@link Supervisor.Reading} into a probability `p` and a
 * sentence. A {@link Questioned} monitor adds one boolean question to the
 * supervisor's single Jev call; a {@link Derived} monitor scores answers the
 * supervisor already asks and costs nothing. {@link evaluate} runs at reading
 * time and renders every crossed monitor's text against the reading's own
 * snapshot. {@link gate} runs later, at the recorded steering drain, against
 * the durable {@link Ledger}: it applies each monitor's streak, cooldown and
 * limit and delivers at most one message.
 *
 * Both halves are pure. Nothing here asks Jev, journals, or steers.
