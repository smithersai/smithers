/**
 * The reading Jev takes of a run while it is still running.
 *
 * Every other control in this package reads a completion, or reads one fact
 * the harness measured: a tree that never moved, a check that was narrowed, a
 * frame that repeated itself. Each is exact, each fires late, and each is
 * silent about the run between its brakes. A run that edits the wrong file
 * for twenty frames, re-runs one failing check after every edit and never
 * once claims to be done trips none of them until its budget is gone.
 *
 * So this module asks Jev about the run's *shape* rather than its sentence.
 * One classifier, `supervisor/turn`, over a {@link Snapshot} the controller
 * assembles from what it already holds: the task, the newest frames, and the
 * counts the deterministic controls keep — read-only streak, repeat streak,
 * mutations, checks run and failing, unanswered failures, demands spent. It
 * re-derives none of them. Beside the run's state it carries a bounded list
 * of sentences the run wrote that might be worth keeping, the skills it has
 * not called, the flows it has, and whether it can call `jev`. One Jev call per
 * snapshot answers every question at once.
 *
 * Eleven questions are fixed. Five are about the run: whether it is
 * thrashing, whether it is still on the task, whether its evidence is
 * suspect, and whether it carries outdated or irrelevant context. Five are
 * operational states a person would recognise in a colleague, each scored
 * `none`, `mild` or `strong` against evidence the snapshot names, and
 * `needs_help` is the one word a person is shown. The five about the run are
 * the {@link triggers}: any one past its threshold crosses. A boolean per
 * candidate sentence decides what is written to memory, and each monitor the
 * host arms may add one boolean of its own, under {@link monitorPrefix}.
 *
 * Rows recalled from {@link Memory} are not asked about here. Beside each
 * reading, the supervisor asks `Relevance` which of up to
 * {@link recalledLimit} rows, none already shown to the run, are unnecessary
 * for the task; the rest are shown at the next boundary as
 * {@link recalledInsert} renders them, and a row is shown to a run once.
 *
 * It is a supervisor and not a brake: nothing here ends a run, refuses a
 * completion, or decides anything on the cell loop's hot path. `CellTurn`
 * offers each frame's snapshot to a one-slot sliding queue and continues; a
 * forked fiber takes the newest snapshot, asks, journals what came back, and
 * hands the monitors' values and any memory to the *next* turn boundary,
 * which decides there what the run is told. A reading that arrives after the boundary it was for is
 * journaled and never delivered, and a snapshot the fiber never reached is
 * dropped: the run is never told something about a frame two frames gone.
 *
 * It never falls back. A snapshot Jev could not read is journaled as
 * {@link AgentEvent.SupervisorUnjudged} with the transport's own reason; it
 * nudges nothing, remembers nothing, and is never counted as a reading that
 * found the run calm or on target. Nothing here is a default value: every
 * level and every word on the settled event came back from the transport.
 *
 * What a reading says is delivered wherever the host holds a real judge
 * (`CellTurn.Input.judged`), and only through a monitor that crossed and
 * passed its gates; the text of the legacy nudge is {@link nudge}, which the
 * `supervisor` lint monitor says. The offline replay of archived journals
 * (`evals/swebench/lib/jev-replay.mjs`, which scores {@link triggers} itself
 * rather than a copy of it) measures their precision. The verdict is
 * journaled whenever an `Evaluator` is bound. Remembering is behind
 * {@link Options.remember}, off unless the host opts in, and writes nothing
 * unless a {@link Memory} is bound.
