/**
 * The narrowing ledger: which checks this run has run, and over which tree.
 *
 * A run finishes by claiming its work is done. The evidence for that claim is
 * the checks it actually ran, and a check is only evidence for the tree it ran
 * over. The failure this module names is a completion whose last check is a
 * *narrowed* version of one the run had already run in full, taken after the
 * workspace moved and never followed by the broad one: the narrow result is
 * true, the broad one is unknown, and the run reports the unknown half as
 * proven.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical, and it is not one instance's accident. On a graded
 * benchmark the same run shape decided the same instance twice, in two
 * consecutive waves, identically. The journal of the second reads: the run ran
 * `pytest -rA testing/test_collection.py` in full, used its three failures to
 * discard a wrong candidate, edited two source files, re-ran the *same command
 * with a `-k` filter selecting four of seventy-two names* — "4 passed, 68
 * deselected" — and completed on that frame. The graded patch passed both
 * target tests and 144 of 145 neighbours; the one it broke was among the 68 the
 * filter dropped, and the run had watched that exact test pass, on the exact
 * command, before the change that broke it.
 *
 * The harness does not re-run anything to find this out. It compares two things
 * it already records — the input of every call, and the workspace digest each
 * frame closed on — and hands the run one sentence naming the check it is
 * missing. What the run does with that is the run's business: re-run the broad
 * check, or say why it no longer applies. The loop asks once and accepts what
 * comes back, because a harness that verified completions itself would be
 * grading the agent's work with its own, and that hack was removed on purpose.
 *
 * The module names two shapes of the same failure, and the second is here
 * because the first was escaped from the other side. {@link find} is
 * broad-then-narrow, above. {@link findOnly} is narrow-only: the next wave of
 * the same instance ran a filtered reading of the right file, ran nothing else,
 * and completed — so there was no broader check in the ledger and nothing to
 * narrow. Both readings deselected the one neighbour the patch broke.

 * took a filtered reading of the right one and ran nothing else — and the

 * The harness cannot see that a filter is a filter without learning one test
 * runner's flags, so it does not try. It asks the question the record can
 * answer: is this reading the only one this run has of what it names, and does
 * it carry a phrase this run alone put there.
 *
 * Five conditions, each read off the run's own record:
 *
 * 1. the completing frame ran at least one check, and the subject is its
 *    *last* one — the reading the completion stands closest to, as
 *    `UnresolvedFailure` reads its own ledger;
 * 2. that check names at least one subject ({@link names}) and carries at
 *    least one condition ({@link conditions}) the run itself added: a term
 *    that is not in the text the run was handed (`taught`) and not in any
 *    other check the run has made. A term the harness taught the run — the
 *    runner its task names, a flag the task prescribes, an envelope value its
 *    own example shows — is the run doing as it was told, and a term the run
 *    uses in its other checks is how this run phrases a question. Neither is
 *    a condition this check put on its subjects, and a check whose every
 *    non-target term is accounted for one of those two ways carries nothing
 *    the demand could ask to see removed;
 * 3. the run never ran this exact call before this frame. A call replayed from
 *    an earlier frame is the run's own baseline re-run byte for byte, which is
 *    the discipline the contract asks for and the opposite of the failure here;
 * 4. every subject it names is named by some other check of this run, so these
 *    are subjects the run has been working on rather than a container path or a
 *    scratch directory that one command creates and uses;
 * 5. no other check of this run names all of them together, so nothing in the
 *    record says what they report as one.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately cannot see
 *
 * Conditions 4 and 5 together mean a check naming exactly *one* subject is
 * never named: if the run read that subject anywhere else, that reading covers
 * this one, and if it did not, there is nothing to corroborate against. So the
 * demand is about a *combination* the run has read only through one command,
 * and a single filtered file with no other mention of the file in the run goes
 * unremarked.
 *
 * That is a chosen floor rather than an oversight. Three benchmark waves
 * produced fifteen completions between them, and the shapes are not separable
 * above it: the losing run's `check <file> -k "<two cases>"` and a resolved
 * run's `check <file-a> <file-b>` differ only in what the flag means, which is
 * a fact about one test runner. Every weaker condition tried against those
 * fifteen runs fired on one or both of the two best rounds the harness has ever
 * scored — a demand costing a correct round a frame to ask about a check that
 * carries no condition at all. This one speaks once, to the run that lost its
 * instance to a filter, naming the command that carried it, and says nothing to
 * the other fourteen.
 *
 * Condition 2's second half was measured in, not reasoned in. The r97 wave
 * fired this demand five times: twice on completions standing on a `-k`
 * filter — the failure the module exists to catch — and three times on runs
 * whose last check ran a whole test module exactly as their task text
 * prescribed, `<interpreter> -m <runner> <flag> <file>`. Each of those three
 * answered the demand by re-issuing the identical completion with a sentence
 * saying the check carried no filter, and each was accepted: the demand
 * taught the harness nothing and cost a correct run one full-context frame.
 * What separates the five in the record is exactly condition 2: every
 * non-target term of the three was taught by the run's own prompt, part of
 * the input's own shape, or already in the run's other checks, and the two
 * that deserved the demand each carried a filter phrase found nowhere else in
 * the run. The residual errors both suppress: a run whose task text happens
 * to contain a term it later uses as a filter, or whose earlier checks
 * carried the same filter flag over other subjects, completes unasked — and a
