 * union, which is encoded through the durable exit schema for journaling. A
 * raw `Error` (or any other non-JSON value) attached as `cause` has no safe
 * JSON representation under `Schema.Unknown`, so encoding it dies with a
 * `SchemaError` that replaces the real failure instead of reporting it.
 * `Schema.Defect` decodes to the same `unknown` type but encodes any value —
 * including a real `Error` — to JSON, with the same graceful degradation
 * `Cause` defects already rely on elsewhere in this codebase.
