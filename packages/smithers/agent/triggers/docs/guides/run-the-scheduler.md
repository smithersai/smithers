The scheduler is a poll loop. Every tick it lists every trigger, recovers the
occurrences already running, skips the disabled ones, works out what each of
the rest owes, claims what is due, and launches through a `Runner`. This guide
composes it into a host.

## Compose the layers

Three layers stack, bottom to top: a database, a store over it, and a runner
beside it.

```ts
import * as DurableWriter from "@smthrs/database/DurableWriter"
import * as NodeDatabase from "@smthrs/database/node/NodeDatabase"
import * as Scheduler from "@smthrs/triggers/Scheduler"
import * as SqlTriggerStore from "@smthrs/triggers/SqlTriggerStore"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

const database = Layer.provideMerge(
  DurableWriter.layer(),
  NodeDatabase.layer({ filename: "smithers.db" })
)

/** Requires Control.Control, and provides a running Scheduler. */
export const triggers = Scheduler.layer({ pollInterval: "30 seconds" }).pipe(
  Layer.provide(Scheduler.layerControlRunner),
  Layer.provide(SqlTriggerStore.layer),
  Layer.provide(database)
)
```

`SqlTriggerStore.layer` applies the package's migrations when it builds, so
there is nothing to run beforehand. `Scheduler.layerControlRunner` is the
production launcher: it requires `Control.Control` from
[`@smthrs/control`](/api/control) and reaches nothing else.

`Scheduler.layer` forks a supervisor fiber into the layer's scope. It sleeps
only through the Effect `Clock`, so scope closure interrupts it. It also
recovers from the whole cause of a failed tick, not just the typed error: a
defect raised anywhere under a tick would otherwise kill the fiber and stop
every trigger in the process with nothing written down.

## Choose the two intervals

```ts
Scheduler.layer({ pollInterval: "30 seconds", runPollInterval: "5 seconds" })
```

| Option            | Default        | What it paces                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pollInterval`    | `"1 minute"`   | How often a tick lists triggers and evaluates due work.                                |
| `runPollInterval` | `"1 second"`   | How often a launched run's monitor asks the runner whether it is still active.         |
| `host`            | `"local"`      | The name every tick records its heartbeat under, so a listing can say who last polled. |
| `concurrency`     | `4`            | How many triggers one tick processes at the same time.                                 |
| `startTimeout`    | `"4 minutes"`  | How long one `Runner.start` may take before the launch is abandoned and left pending.  |
| `inspectTimeout`  | `"30 seconds"` | How long one `Runner.isActive` may take before it counts as a failed inspection.       |
| `cancelTimeout`   | `"30 seconds"` | How long one `Runner.cancel` may take before the supersede fails and is compensated.   |

Both must be finite, positive Effect durations. Zero polls a CPU-tight loop and
an infinite interval never completes, and `Duration.fromInput` accepts both, so
the scheduler refuses them itself with `invalid_options` and
`TriggerError.path` naming the field.

Set `pollInterval` below the tightest schedule you run. A one-minute cron under
a five-minute poll still fires, because catch-up replays the boundaries the poll
skipped, but only if the declaration asked for catch-up.

## Bound a slow runner

A tick processes up to `concurrency` triggers at once and waits for each
launch to be acknowledged, so one launch waiting on a parked plan holds one
slot, not the triggers listed after it. Every runner call also carries a
deadline. A call that exceeds it is interrupted and fails with
`runner_timeout`, and the durable state a retry needs is kept:

- A start that timed out is ambiguous, because the runtime may hold the run.
  The occurrence stays pending and the next tick retries it under the same
  `idempotencyKey`, so a runtime that did start the run answers with the same
  run id instead of a second run.
- An inspection that timed out is retried like any inspection failure, and the
  monitor detaches after three retries with the owner retained.
- A cancellation that timed out restores the prior run as active and queues the
  replacement.

The tick still waits up to `startTimeout` for its slowest launch, and the
supervisor sleeps `pollInterval` only after the tick returns. Boundaries that
pass during that wait are replayed only if the declaration asked for catch-up.
Keep `startTimeout` above the two minutes `parkedAttempts` allows when
scheduled flows can park for approval.

## Let the control plane read the store

`Control.list` answers `{ _tag: "triggers" }` and `{ _tag: "fires" }` through
the `DispatchReader` port declared in `@smthrs/control`. This package serves
that port from the store. Provide it beside the scheduler, over the same store:

```ts
import * as DispatchReader from "@smthrs/triggers/DispatchReader"

export const dispatchReader = DispatchReader.layer.pipe(
  Layer.provide(SqlTriggerStore.layer),
  Layer.provide(database)
)
```

Each trigger summary carries its last fire, its buffered occurrence, the run it
holds, the next five occurrences, and `schedulerLastTickMs` from the newest
heartbeat. A summary with no `schedulerLastTickMs` means no scheduler has ever
polled this store, so an enabled trigger is not going to fire. Without the
layer, `Control.list` refuses both variants with `InvalidInput` naming the
missing store; it never answers an empty page it cannot stand behind.

## Tick without a supervisor

`Scheduler.make` returns the same service without forking anything, so the
caller decides when a tick happens. Use it in tests, in a one-shot process, or
under a scheduler you already own:

```ts
import * as Scheduler from "@smthrs/triggers/Scheduler"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const oneTick = Effect.scoped(Effect.gen(function*() {
  const scheduler = yield* Scheduler.make()
  yield* scheduler.runOnce
}))
```

`runOnce` holds a semaphore permit, so two concurrent calls on one scheduler
serialize rather than interleave.

`Scheduler.makeNoop` and `Scheduler.layerNoop` provide an inert scheduler
without allocating a supervisor fiber, for a composition that needs the service
in scope but no scheduling.

## What a parked plan does

`layerControlRunner` calls `control.plan`, then runs the returned plan. When
Control answers `Parked`, the plan is waiting for a human approval. The runner
re-offers the same idempotent request with a delay that doubles from one
second, up to `Scheduler.parkedAttempts`, which is 8. The eighth attempt lands a
little over two minutes in, and the launch then fails with `runner`.

The runner never approves the plan and never reconstructs an execution
envelope. A schedule that keeps parking is a schedule whose flow needs an
approval nobody is giving.

## Shutdown does not cancel runs

Closing the scheduler's scope interrupts the poll loop and detaches every run
monitor. It stops there on purpose: the runs themselves are durable and outlive
the process, so a deploy must leave them alone. The next incarnation re-attaches
to them by reading the store.

Cancellation is a deliberate act, and the only thing that performs it is a
`supersede` claim replacing a run in flight.

## Failure isolation

A tick walks the due triggers in id order. One trigger's failure is logged with
its id annotated and does not stop the triggers after it, and a failed
occurrence stays available to a later poll rather than being marked handled.
Interruption is the exception: it is the scope closing, not a trigger failing,
so it propagates.
