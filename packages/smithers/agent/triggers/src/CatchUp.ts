 *
 * Every policy answers to `maxCatchUp`, `one` included: a bound of zero says
 * no occurrence may be caught up, so a missed occurrence under `one` is
 * `catch_up_bound_exceeded` exactly as three missed occurrences under `all`
 * are. The bound is validated before any policy branch, so an unusable bound
 * is refused even where the policy owes nothing.
