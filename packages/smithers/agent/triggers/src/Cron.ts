/**
 * Typed wrappers around Effect Cron.
 *
 * Effect's field parser only range-checks each field, so an expression like
 * `0 0 30 2 *` parses and then never matches a calendar date. Its occurrence
 * search answers that by exhausting its bound and throwing, which inside
 * `Effect.gen` is a defect rather than a typed failure: the fiber that owns the
 * search dies instead of reporting. Every search here is wrapped so the
 * exhausted bound arrives as `unsatisfiable_cron`, and {@link parse} probes for
 * one occurrence so an unsatisfiable expression is refused where it is
 * declared rather than at the tick that would have fired it.
 *
 * A satisfiable expression carries the opposite hazard: `* * * * *` across a
 * year is 525,600 occurrences, and materializing them costs seconds and
 * hundreds of megabytes. {@link occurrencesBetween} therefore always searches
 * under a finite cap and reports when an unstated limit would exceed
 * {@link maxOccurrences}.
 *
 * A timezone makes the expression a wall-clock schedule. A wall time that
 * spring forward skips fires at the instant it would have had on the old
 * offset, so a daily 02:30 fires at 03:30 daylight time. A wall time that fall
 * back repeats fires once, at its first instant, unless the hour field is every
 * hour, in which case both passes fire. Occurrences are whole seconds in UTC,
 * whatever the host's zone.
