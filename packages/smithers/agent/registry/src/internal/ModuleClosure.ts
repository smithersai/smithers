/**
 * The other files a discovered module's body runs.
 *
 * A module body's `contentDigest` measures the ENTRY FILE and nothing else,
 * and {@link module:Executable.fromDescriptor} imports a verified copy of those
 * entry bytes written as a SIBLING of the original, precisely so the entry's
 * relative imports resolve to the live files beside it. Everything reached that
 * way is code the flow runs and the entry digest never saw: a sibling edited
 * after a plan was approved would keep the approval.
 *
 * This module closes that gap by naming what the entry reaches. It walks the
 * transitive closure of RELATIVE specifiers (`./`, `../`) statically — the same
 * lexer `ModuleMetadata` reads declarations with — and records each reached
 * module as a path relative to the entry's directory plus the digest of its
 * bytes. Discovery puts that list on the module {@link module:Descriptor.BodyRef},
 * so it rides `Descriptor.executionDigest` through the existing schema
 * encoding, and the loader recomputes it before importing anything.
 *
 * BARE SPECIFIERS ARE OUT OF SCOPE. `@smthrs/flow`, `effect`, and every other
 * package specifier resolve into installed code, which is the host's own code
 * and carries the host's trust; a flow that can name a package can already name
 * the package the host itself runs on. Only the project's own files — the ones
 * an author edits beside the flow — are pinned here.
 *
 * TYPE-ONLY IMPORTS ARE PINNED TOO. `import type ... from "./x.ts"` is erased
 * before anything runs, so pinning it is conservative rather than necessary. It
 * costs an approval when a types-only sibling changes and saves deciding, per
 * specifier, whether a compiler would have erased it.
