/**
 * Turning a discovered descriptor into something the durable engine runs.
 *
 * Discovery answers *what flows exist*: a {@link module:Descriptor.FlowDescriptor}
 * is metadata read without evaluating anything, with the body left behind a
 * {@link module:Descriptor.BodyRef}. Nothing in that answer is executable, so
 * `smithers up <flow>` could print a plan card and stop. This module is the
 * missing half: it loads the body a descriptor points at, resolves the
 * `@smthrs/flow` flow the descriptor delegates to, and returns a durable flow
 * plus the `Interpreter` layer that registers it with the runtime.
 *
 * A discovered flow arrives in one of two shapes. A module that
 * default-exports a `@smthrs/flow` flow IS the work: its own body is the plan,
 * and {@link selfDelegate} makes it its own delegate so nothing has to be
 * registered under a name. Everything else — a markdown `flows:` frontmatter
 * list, a `@smthrs/core` `Flow.make({ flows })` — declares WHAT it delegates
 * to, and the host declares HOW that work runs by registering `@smthrs/flow`
 * flows under those names.
 *
 * The bridge deliberately does not compile a `@smthrs/core` graph into a plan.
 * For a delegating descriptor one delegating node is therefore the whole
 * lowering. Either way the runtime decisions the descriptor carries ride the
 * same lowering:
 *
 * - the declared cache policy goes onto the ACTION the bridged flow
 *   dispatches, which is the value `@smthrs/engine-store` `ActionPersistence`
 *   reads a policy off: `ttlMs` bounds the age of the row the engine may
 *   serve and `scope` narrows the address it is stored under. Declaring one is
 *   also what makes the delegation a single dispatched step at all; read
 *   {@link Lowered.cache} and {@link dispatchedAction} for the shape and for
 *   the one gate a policy still has to pass;
 * - `Node.priority` becomes the delegating node's priority, which is what
 *   reaches `NodeDraft.priority` and `@smthrs/engine-store`'s `PlanScheduler`.
 *   The rc.0 `up` path settles a flow through `@smthrs/flow` `Interpreter`,
 *   which admits every ready node at once, so the priority orders scheduled
 *   plans and nothing else;
 * - the placement directive becomes both the flow's placement annotation,
 *   which is the one key `@smthrs/plan` declares, and a field of the
 *   {@link Invocation} the delegate reads, which is what a host selects a
 *   spawn target with.
 *
 * A delegate the host never registered is refused HERE, with an
 * {@link ExecutableError} naming it, rather than at dispatch: an unresolved
 * call inside the engine dies with an empty `AnyOf` issue that names nothing
 * during dispatch, and a missing flow is a wiring mistake
 * an operator can fix only if the message says which flow is missing.

 *
 * This is the layer a host passes as the durable runtime's registration phase:
 * once it has been built, `Control.run` on a discovered flow reaches a
 * registered durable flow instead of an empty catalog.
 *
 * A refusal is never silent. Each one is logged as a warning naming the flow,
 * the code, the delegate it wanted, and what is registered instead, and the
 * whole {@link Catalog} is provided as a service, so a host can print the
 * refusals rather than let an operator discover them from `up <flow>` failing
 * inside the runtime.
 *
 * The catalog it provides is not frozen. It used to be, and that was wrong for
 * a host whose own runs write into its `flows/` directory: an agent that
 * authors `flows/<id>/flow.ts` produced a file nothing on the host could plan
 * or execute, because the descriptor existed and the executable behind it did
 * not, and only a restart closed the gap. {@link Refresh} is the one operation
 * that closes it instead. Two properties make it safe to call on a serving
 * host:
 *
 * - the `Catalog` service object never changes identity. `AgentSession`,
 *   admission and the plan hook each read the catalog they were handed while
 *   the host was composed, so a refresh swaps the SNAPSHOT those readers see
 *   rather than the service they hold. The swap is one assignment: a reader
 *   observes the entry list before it or after it, never a half-built one;
 * - the new body is registered with the runtime BEFORE the previous body's
 *   scope is closed. `@smthrs/flow` keys registrations by flow tag and a
 *   scope release removes only the registration it still owns, so an
 *   execution dispatched across the swap reaches one body or the other and
 *   never an unregistered tag.
 *
 * Re-importing is not a problem the caller has to solve: the default loader
 * writes the verified bytes to a private sibling named by their content
 * digest and imports THAT, so new bytes are a new module specifier and the
 * ESM cache cannot answer with the previous body. The cost is retention: each
 * load has its own specifier and ESM offers no unload, so the process keeps
 * every module it has loaded for its lifetime, one per load of each flow. A
 * long-lived host that refreshes often should expect that growth.
