/**
 * Workflow packs: a directory of flows with a manifest, a content address, and
 * a merge order.
 *
 * `Discovery` already answers "what flows are in this directory". A pack adds
 * the three things a shareable directory needs and a bare directory cannot
 * carry: a *name and version* so a descriptor can say where it came from, a
 * *content address* so a lock file can pin exactly the bytes that were
 * installed, and a *compatibility range* so a pack written against a newer
 * runtime is refused at load rather than halfway through a run.
 *
 * The old smithers verbs (`pack add | remove | list | update | eject`) are the
 * CLI half and are not here. This module is the runtime contract underneath
 * them. It holds one filesystem policy: every contributed source must remain
 * inside its pack root. Discovery checks descended directories and selected
 * entry files against that root when the host can resolve real paths.
 * Packs are third-party content, so callers cannot be trusted to have
 * validated manifest paths or symlink targets first.
 *
 * Precedence is `local` before `installed`, by name. That is the one rule the
 * old pack system had that a plain source list cannot express: two sources
 * merge first-found in scan order, so an installed pack listed first would win
 * a name a project pack defines. Here the origin decides, and the loser is
 * reported as a {@link module:Descriptor.DiscoveryWarning} naming both packs
 * rather than dropped silently.
