/**
 * A policy-declaring flow whose effect declaration keeps it out of the
 * cross-run cache anyway: it names file inputs as patterns and calls its
 * boundary `expected` rather than `hermetic`.
 *
 * A declared read carries no digest at discovery time, so the bridge lowers
 * the whole read set as one glob, and the engine refuses to reuse a result
 * whose key cannot say which expansion it names. `expected` says the two sets
 * are a best effort, which is not the hard boundary a shared result needs.
