/**
 * The three properties a rebuild-while-serving host rests on.
 *
 * `ExecutableRefresh.test.ts` proves the seam does its job: a flow written
 * after startup becomes plannable, an edited one adopts its new delegate, a
 * refused one keeps the catalog honest. None of that says the rebuild is SAFE
 * to run on a host that is already serving, and three separate guarantees
 * carry that weight:
 *
 * 1. The module a load imports is a file that load created. The exclusive
 *    `wx` create is the whole reservation — no temp directory is available to
 *    the guarded filesystem a native host composes — so a name another writer
 *    already holds must cost this load an attempt and reach nothing, and a
 *    load that cannot find a free name must refuse rather than overwrite one.
 * 2. The new body is registered with the runtime BEFORE the previous one's
 *    scope closes, so an execution dispatched across the swap always has a
 *    body to reach.
 * 3. Refreshes are serialized, so two rebuilds of one name cannot interleave
 *    their registration and leave the loser's scope held by nobody.
 *
 * Each of the three is asserted here against the behaviour that would break
 * it, not against the code that implements it.
