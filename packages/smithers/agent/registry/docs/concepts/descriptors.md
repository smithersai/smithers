A `FlowDescriptor` is what discovery produces: everything about one flow except
the flow itself. It is a serializable value, so a host can journal it, send it
over a wire, or compare two of them, and nothing in it is a closure, a module
handle, or an open file.

## Discovery is metadata-only

Scanning a source never evaluates a module and never reads a prompt body into
the result. The scan reads and hashes each entry file whole, up to
`Discovery.entrySizeLimit`, then parses at most its first 64 KiB looking for the
metadata: the closing frontmatter fence for markdown, the end of the default
`Flow.make` value for a module. The 64 KiB ceiling bounds parsing, not the read.
A catalog of a thousand flows therefore costs a thousand reads and hashes, a
thousand frontmatter parses, and no imports.

That rule is what makes a catalog cheap enough to build at startup, and it is
also what makes it safe. A `flows/` directory is a directory a person edits and
a pack installs into. Evaluating every module in it to find out what is there
would run third-party code before anyone decided to.

The consequence is that a descriptor describes a schema by reference rather
than by value. `SchemaRefModule` records that a module's default export has an
`input` field and where the file is; it does not hold the schema, because
holding it would mean importing the module. A markdown flow's input and output
are fixed, so `SchemaRefMarkdownArgs` and `SchemaRefMarkdownOutput` are markers
with nothing to locate. `SchemaRefInline` is the one variant that carries a
schema by value, as a JSON Schema document, for a host that already holds the
declaration and has nothing to point at.

## The body stays behind a reference

`FlowDescriptor.body` is a `BodyRef`: a path, and for a markdown body the
directory its own resources are resolved against. Loading is a separate,
explicit call, `Registry.loadBody`, and it is the only registry read that
touches the filesystem again.

A `BodyRef` also records `contentDigest`, the SHA-256 of the complete entry
file measured during the scan. That digest is what makes a lazily loaded body
honest. `Registry.loadBody` and `Executable.fromDescriptor` rehash the bytes
they read and refuse with `body_unavailable` when the file changed after
discovery or `contentDigest` is absent. Older journaled descriptors still decode
and can be listed, but their unmeasured bodies cannot be loaded or run. Refresh
the registry to measure the current bytes before loading them. The default
executable loader evaluates those verified entry bytes under a fresh,
digest-qualified module identity, so refresh adopts edited priority, cache,
and placement annotations even after an earlier load in the same process.
The entry digest does not cover imported dependencies; those retain the host's
normal module cache.

Body paths may be filesystem paths or `file:` URLs. Verification decodes file
URLs, including percent-encoded filenames, through the host `Path` service.
Custom module loaders receive the original URL plus the verified bytes and
digest. The default loader imports a private temporary sibling of the source,
preserving its directory for relative imports. See
[Executable.Options](../api.md#executableoptions) for loader requirements and
catalog deadlines.

## What a descriptor carries

| Field             | What it is                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`            | The registry name, derived from the source's naming mode.           |
| `description`     | The one line a model and an autocomplete list are shown. Required.  |
| `body`            | The `BodyRef` and its content digest.                               |
| `input`, `output` | `SchemaRef` locators, or the fixed markdown markers.                |
| `model`           | The declared seat, as an `Option<string>`.                          |
| `flows`           | The collaborator flows the declaration named.                       |
| `capabilities`    | The authority patterns the declaration named.                       |
| `effects`         | Reads, writes, mode, conflict policy, and reversibility tier.       |
| `placement`       | The declared execution environment, as an `Option`.                 |
| `modelInvocable`  | Whether the flow is disclosed to a model.                           |
| `budget`          | The ceilings a control plane should approve, when one was declared. |
| `path`            | The entry file the descriptor was read from.                        |
| `frontmatter`     | Every frontmatter key, retained verbatim as JSON.                   |
| `provenance`      | The source, the root, and the pack, when there was one.             |

`effects` and `capabilities` are the declared-authority half, and they carry
more weight than a label: read [Declared authority](./authority.md).

## A registry owns what it hands out

Every registry constructor copies each descriptor and every array, record, and
option inside it, freezes the copy, and snapshots the configuration it was
given. Two consequences a caller can rely on:

| Action                                                               | Effect on later reads                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutating a descriptor passed to `layerFromDescriptors`               | None. The registry answers from its own copy.              |
| Mutating a descriptor returned by `list`, `visible`, or `get`        | Rejected. Returned descriptors are frozen.                 |
| Mutating the `sources` or `packs.installed` array after construction | None. The configuration was snapshotted.                   |
| Mutating an `Invocation` a delegate received                         | Rejected. The envelope and its contents are frozen copies. |

The envelope matters twice over, because the same values are captured as the
delegating node's durable identity. Freezing them is what keeps the envelope a
delegate reads and the key material the engine recorded from diverging.

The guarantee costs one traversal per descriptor per `refresh`, through a
single identity map, over metadata the scan already parsed. That traversal
reads no file and loads no body, so a refresh costs what a scan costs, one
read, hash, and frontmatter parse per flow, plus one copy of what that parse
produced. The single map is also what keeps a value two fields reference from
coming back as two objects.
