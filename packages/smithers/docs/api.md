title: "API reference"
description: "Every public export of @smthrs/cli, module by module: the command tree, the Node composition, the output and terminal renderers, the verb catalogs, and the operational modules behind each verb."
---

The root entry point exports each public module as a namespace. Import a module directly with `@smthrs/cli/<Module>`.

`@smthrs/cli/package.json` is exported. `@smthrs/cli/internal/*` and
`@smthrs/cli/*/index` are blocked in the export map.

The nested `cli/*`, `evaluation/*`, `history/*`, `operator/*`, and `suggest/*`
entries in the export map are subpath-only: `@smthrs/cli/<dir>/<Module>`
resolves and no root namespace does. The package README lists them.

## Trust boundaries

Four rules hold across every module below, and each one is a property of the
composition rather than of a single call site.

**Credentials stay out of process arguments.** The local executor reads a
provider credential only while resolving a model route. A detached launch
inherits the parent's environment, including `SMITHERS_API_KEY`, and puts only
the approval payload, `--mcp-config`, and `--root` on the child's command line.

**Agent-reachable equipment runs guarded.** `layerGuardedPlatform` resolves,
authorizes, re-resolves, and executes every filesystem operation relative to a
pinned root descriptor, and the same `GrantStore` must be given to the
filesystem and to the process spawner: a filesystem pinned to an allow-all
store beside a shell pinned to a real one is a fail-open the types would not
catch. `layerHostPlatform` is the unguarded half, and only host equipment that
carries its own confinement argument runs on it.

**Non-loopback binds are refused by default.** A gateway on anything but
`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or `localhost` needs both an explicit `--listen` and a
bearer token. `Serve.refuse` is the rule, and `NodeControl.layerServer`
enforces it again synchronously before the server layer is built.

**Caller-controlled data cannot imitate a receipt.** MCP arguments are decoded
against the same closed schemas the server advertises, and failures are
redacted before they cross the protocol boundary. Stored and projected values
are rendered through `Output.renderValue`, so only a validated control receipt
can set a nonzero process status.

## Cli

`Cli.makeCli(config?)` builds the unified Incur command tree. Its Zod schemas
describe target, flow, run, approval, and operator commands; handlers acquire
Effect services only after parsing. Use `.serve(argv)` to run the tree in a
Node host. See the [CLI reference](./reference/cli/README.md) for command
groups, machine output, and local-only features.

## Audience

`Audience` is also available from `@smthrs/cli/Audience`. It re-exports the
shared build/control presentation policy, without acquiring runtime services.

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Mode` | Explicit `auto`, `human`, or `agent` selection. |
| `Options` | Injected environment, stream capabilities, format, MCP, and verbosity choices. |
| `Policy` | Audience, selection source, matched harness names, result encoding policy, progress mode, and prompt capability. |
| `Marker`, `markers` | Source-verified runtime marker registry; no credential or installation probing. |
| `resolve(options?)` | Pure audience and presentation resolution; evidence contains names, never environment values. |
| `fromArguments(argv, options?)` | Resolves presentation flags without loading a workspace. |
| `incurArguments(argv, policy)` | Selects structured Incur formatting for agent-owned terminals; logs default to incremental JSONL. |

Explicit selection overrides detection, and MCP always remains machine-clean.
This policy affects rendering only, not approvals or permissions. See
[human and agent output](./reference/cli/README.md#human-and-agent-output).

## Command

The retained Effect CLI compatibility tree, used by hidden flat aliases.
New hosts should use `Cli.makeCli` for the unified public surface.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cli` | `Command` | The root command: every shipped verb with a handler, every removed verb and flag as a hidden refusal. |
| `migrationCli` | `Command` | Local migration inspection tree, composed without opening execution databases. |
| `doctorCli` | `Command` | Local diagnostics tree using the discovery snapshot without opening execution databases. |
| `signalKey` | `(runId: string, payload: SignalPayload) => string` | The idempotency key of one signal delivery: `cli:signal:<run-id>:<digest>`. The payload digest is part of the key because two different signals to one run are two mutations. |
| `latestSequence` | `<E, R>(events: Stream<{ sequence: number }, E, R>) => Effect<number \| undefined, E, R>` | The greatest sequence in a stream, folded without retaining history. Stream failures are preserved, so a caller never substitutes a weaker cursor after a failed read. |

Run-control handlers use `Control` for local and remote execution. Local
diagnostic and filesystem commands retain their documented remote refusals.

## Application

The transport-neutral composition.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Config` | interface | `remote`, `credential`, `mcpServers`, `root`, `migrationRoot`. Read off argv and the environment before any layer is built, so a handler only ever sees a valid one. |
| `Engine` | interface | `runtime` and `journal`: where a local composition's runs and events are recorded. The journal is required, not optional. |
| `engineMemory` | `Engine` | A deterministic runtime over an in-memory SQLite journal. Nothing it records survives the process. |
| `layer` | `(config, registry?, engine?, executor?) => Layer<Control, never, HttpClient \| RpcSerialization \| Socket>` | Local `Control` when `config.remote` is unset, the RPC client otherwise. Also supplies `ExecutorOwnership`. |

`executor` must be passed here rather than provided from outside, because
`ControlLive` resolves it with `Effect.serviceOption` while its own layer is
built. Omitting it leaves every run `pending`.

## NodeControl

The Node composition for the command tree.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Environment` | `Environment.Source` | The environment shape configuration helpers read. |
| `ServerOptions` | `ListenOptions & { disablePreemptiveShutdown?, listen? }` | Node listen options, with the explicit non-loopback opt-in. |
| `makeConfig` | `(args, environment, cwd) => Application.Config` | The pure configuration boundary. Throws `CliError.UsageError` for a bad `--remote` URL or an unreadable, malformed, or wrongly shaped `--mcp-config` file. |
| `configFromArguments` | `(args) => Effect<Application.Config, CliError.UsageError>` | Resolves and validates raw arguments or a shared parse using the ambient environment and working directory. |
| `config` | `Effect<Application.Config, CliError.UsageError>` | `makeConfig` applied to the ambient process, with the throw converted into a typed failure. |
| `projectSources` | `(root: string) => ReadonlyArray<Descriptor.Source>` | The one flow source a local CLI discovers: `<root>/flows`, named by path. |
| `layerHostPlatform` | `Layer` | Node's services plus the descriptor-relative, no-follow filesystem the kernel needs. Unguarded; only host equipment that carries its own confinement argument runs on it. |
| `layerGrantStore` | `(root: string) => Layer<GrantStore>` | The local CLI's real permission store: an allow policy, with the fiber's capability ceiling still enforced. |
| `layerGuardedPlatform` | `(root: string, grants?) => Layer` | The kernel-guarded platform over one workspace root. Every filesystem operation is resolved, authorized, re-resolved, and executed relative to a pinned root descriptor. |
| `layerObserver` | `(root: string) => Layer<WorkspaceObservation.Observer>` | The workspace observer a run's mutation accounting is measured with. |
| `layerRegistry` | `(root: string) => Layer<Registry>` | Flow discovery from `<root>/flows`. A missing directory discovers nothing; any other failure is a startup defect. |
| `databasePath` | `(root: string) => string` | `<root>/.flows/control.db`. |
| `executionDatabasePath` | `(root: string) => string` | `<root>/.flows/engine.db`. |
| `EngineDurable` | `Application.Engine & { stores }` | The durable engine plus the shared database seam other stores hang off. |
| `engineDurable` | `(root: string, registry?) => EngineDurable` | The real project engine. Open, migration, and journal startup failures are promoted to defects. |
| `seatResolver`, `layerSeatResolver` | constructor, layer | Resolves a declared seat string into a credentialed model. |
| `testRunner`, `testFlows`, `checkpointStore` | constructors | The `test` flow's runner, the flows it registers, and the checkpoint store. `testRunner(environment, root, workspaceRoot?)` declares the runner for `workspaceRoot`, named inside the mount `SMITHERS_TEST_CWD` gives `root`. |
| `rebuildableTransport` | constructor | The replaceable HTTP dispatcher a model captures and uses after seat resolution returns. |
| `ModuleRegistration` | `Layer<Executable.Catalog, never, host registration services>` | Optional trusted native module registrations; see [native module hosts](guides/native-module-host.md) for authority and single-executor requirements. |
| `layerExecutor` | `(registry, engine, root, options: { environment, mcpServers?, grants?, requestExecutor?, quotaPolicy?, executionRoot?, modules? }) => Layer<ControlExecutor, never, ControlRuntime \| Journal \| NotificationQueue \| Registry>` | The production run executor. Pass the same `GrantStore` the filesystem gets. `executionRoot` is the checkout runs execute in when it is not `root`; every capability, including the declared test runner, is equipped from it. |
| `layerControl` | `(config, registry?, engine?, modules?) => Layer` | `Control` alone, over the registry and engine you supply. |
| `layerOutput` | `Layer<Output>` | Deterministic rendering that also publishes its status as `process.exitCode`. |
| `layer` | `(config, modules?) => Layer` | The complete command-handler environment. This is the production layer for `smthrs`. |
| `layerMemory` | `(root, engine?) => Layer<MemoryStore>` | The durable memory store over the control database. |
| `layerMemoryRemote` | `Layer<MemoryStore>` | The store a `--remote` invocation gets: none, said out loud. |
| `layerServer` | `(auth, options?) => Layer` | The control HTTP and WebSocket router on a scoped Node server. A non-loopback host without `listen: true` is rejected synchronously. |
| `layerGateway` | `(health, options, root, engine, journal?) => Layer` | The whole workspace gateway on one socket. |
| `layerServerBearerAuth`, `layerServerNoopAuth` | `(options?) => Layer` | The two authentication choices for `layerServer`. |
| `CompositionRootsAreComplete` | type | A compile-time assertion that the executor and both control compositions owe nothing. |

## Output

Deterministic rendering, and the status a process exits on.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Format` | `"human" \| "json"` | Indented, or compact. Member order is UTF-16 code-unit order in both. |
| `Rendered` | `{ text: string; exitCode: number }` | Text ready for stdout, with the status the process should publish. |
| `Service` | `{ render: (value, format) => Effect<Rendered, RenderingError> }` | The rendering service handlers consume. |
| `Output` | `Context.Service` | The service key, `/cli/Output`. |
| `make` | `() => Service` | Builds the service for a platform layer or a focused test. |
| `layer` | `Layer<Output>` | The default layer, with no exit-code transfer. |
| `renderValue` | `(value: unknown) => RenderValue` | Marks caller-controlled data as output, never as a receipt. A wrapped value always exits 0. |
| `exitCode` | `(value: unknown) => number` | The status one value implies. Only a validated `ControlSchema.Receipt` returns nonzero. |
| `maximumDepth` | `128` | Maximum object and array nesting in one render. |
| `maximumMembers` | `10_000` | Maximum enumerable data members in one render. |
| `maximumOutputBytes` | `4 * 1024 * 1024` | Maximum UTF-8 bytes in one rendered document. |

Rendering snapshots inert plain data and refuses executable or unbounded
structures before any output is written, with a stable code and the path of the
first refusing member. See
[Output and exit codes](./concepts/output-and-exit-codes.md).

## Ui

Interactive terminal rendering, with a plain-line fallback.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brand` | `string` | The line `intro` prints when a verb gives it no title: `smthrs <version>`. |
| `Check` | `{ name, level: "ok" \| "warn" \| "fail", detail }` | One line of a checklist. |
| `Spinner` | interface | `start`, `message`, `stop`, `cancel`, `error`. Imperative by nature; the Effect boundary sits around the whole span. |
| `StreamOptions`, `Streamed` | interfaces | How a streamed list is labelled and settled, and what the scan produced. |
| `PickOptions`, `ConfirmOptions` | interfaces | How a pick and a confirmation are presented. `ConfirmOptions.nonInteractive` is required, because the safe answer differs per question. |
| `Service` | interface | `interactive`, `text`, `intro`, `outro`, `note`, `info`, `success`, `step`, `warn`, `error`, `checklist`, `spinner`, `streamSuggestions`, `pickSuggestion`, `confirm`. |
| `Ui` | `Context.Service` | The service key, `/cli/Ui`. |
| `Options` | `{ output, input?, interactive }` | The streams and the interactivity decision one service is built on. |
| `isInteractive` | `(output, input, environment) => boolean` | Both streams are terminals, `CI` is not `"true"`, and `TERM` is not `dumb`. |
| `make` | `(options: Options) => Service` | Builds a service on explicit streams. |
| `layer` | `(environment) => Layer<Ui>` | Builds one on the process streams. |
| `prompting` | `Effect<Service>` | Uses a supplied service, or prompts on stderr whenever stdin is a terminal, keeping stdout available for documents. |
| `current` | `Effect<Service>` | The provided service, or a fallback on the process streams. |
| `renderChecklist` | `(title, checks, { interactive, columns? }) => string` | The pure checklist rendering `smthrs doctor` prints. Non-interactive output is byte-identical to `Doctor.render`. |

A cancelled `text` or `pickSuggestion` is `None` and a cancelled `confirm` is `false`.
`text` requires a nonblank value; in a non-interactive session it returns `None` without reading stdin.
Neither sets exit 130, because a Ctrl+C inside a raw-mode prompt is a keypress,
not a signal.

## CliError

The failures the command-line projection adds on top of the control plane's.

| Export | Exits | Raised when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UsageError` | 2 | The invocation is wrong: an unparseable flag value, a payload that does not match its schema, an argument outside the accepted set. Carries no cause. |
| `UnsupportedError` | 1 | The invocation is spelled correctly and this projection cannot perform it: a removed verb or flag, a reserved system flow, a local-only operation asked of a `--remote` composition. |
| `ResourceLimitError` | 1 | A correct read would exceed a published bound. Carries `operation`, `subject`, `limit`, and `unit`. Both labels are inert, so the failure is safe to print over MCP. |
| `RenderingError` | 1 | Caller-controlled output was not inert bounded data. Carries a stable `code`, the `path` of the first refusing member, and a message. |
| `CliError` | | The union of the four. |
| `exitCode` | | `(error: CliError) => number`. 2 for a usage error, 1 otherwise. |

Statuses 3, 130, and 143 belong to run outcomes rather than failures, and come
from `Output.exitCode`.

## Verb

The shipped command catalog.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Verb` | `{ name, help, aliases, flowId?, builtin? }` | One shipped command. `aliases` are accepted by the parser and hidden from `--help`. `flowId` names the reserved system flow when the control catalog reserves one. |
| `shipped` | `ReadonlyArray<Verb>` | Every command that ships. |
| `subcommands` | `ReadonlyArray<Verb>` | `shipped` minus the built-in ones, which is every verb the command tree registers. |
| `names` | `ReadonlyArray<string>` | Every shipped command name. |
| `find` | `(name: string) => Verb \| undefined` | One shipped verb by name. |

`completions` is the only `builtin` entry: `effect/unstable/cli` provides it as
the global `--completions <shell>` flag rather than as a subcommand.

## Unsupported

The removal surface.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `migrationUrl` | `string` | The base every removal message links into. |
| `RemovedVerb`, `removedVerbs` | `{ name, group, reason, subcommands? }` | Every verb removed in 1.0.0-rc.0, grouped by what it belonged to. |
| `RemovedFlag`, `removedFlags` | `{ parent, flag, reason, anchor }` | Every removed flag, declared hidden on the command that used to carry it. `parent: ""` names the shared globals. |
| `message`, `flagMessage` | `(...) => string` | The removal sentence for a verb, and for a flag. |
| `verbError`, `flagError` | `(...) => UnsupportedError` | Those sentences as failures. |
| `findFlag` | `(parent, flag) => RemovedFlag` | One removed flag, so a handler cannot cite the wrong entry. |
| `refusal` | `(args: ReadonlyArray<string>) => UnsupportedError \| undefined` | The refusal for one raw argv, matched before the parser runs, so a removed verb never opens a database on its way to being refused. |
| `isReservedFlow` | `(flowId: string) => boolean` | Whether an id starts with `system/`. |
| `reservedFlowError` | `(verb, flowId) => UnsupportedError` | The refusal for one. |

## Project

Where an invocation decides it is running.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | `(explicit, cwd, exists?) => string` | `--root`, else the nearest ancestor that anchors a project, else the invocation directory. |
| `legacyRoot` | `(explicit, cwd, exists?) => string` | The same walk anchored on 0.x markers, for `smthrs migrate`. |
| `legacyMarkers` | `ReadonlyArray<string>` | `.smithers`, `smithers.db`, and its WAL and shared-memory files. |
| `stateDirectory`, `logDirectory`, `logFile`, `flowsDirectory` | `(root, ...) => string` | `.flows/`, `.flows/logs/`, `.flows/logs/<run-id>.log`, and `flows/`. |
| `legacyState` | `(cwd, exists?) => ReadonlyArray<string>` | 0.x markers beside a project, skipping any directory that already holds `.flows/`. The notice's input. |
| `legacyDatabases` | `(cwd, exists?) => ReadonlyArray<string>` | Every 0.x `smithers.db` beside a project, not gated on `.flows/`. The report's and the refusal's input. |
| `legacyNotice` | `(path: string) => string` | The one-line stderr notice. |
| `ProjectRoot`, `MigrationRoot`, `LegacyState` | `Context.Reference` | The three answers, as services. |
| `layer` | `(projectRoot, migrationRoot) => Layer` | Provides all three. The 0.x sample is taken while the layers are described, before anything creates `.flows/`. |
| `assertRoot` | `(projectRoot: string) => void` | Throws `UsageError` if the selected root is not an accessible directory, before a command creates durable state. |

## Environment

The closed set of variables rc.0 reads.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Name`, `names` | `{ name, purpose }` | Every `SMITHERS_*` variable the CLI reads, with what it is for. |
| `Source` | `Readonly<Record<string, string \| undefined>>` | The shape this module reads. `process.env` satisfies it. |
| `read` | `(environment, name) => string \| undefined` | One name. An empty value is treated exactly like an unset one. |
| `readInteger` | `(environment, name) => number \| undefined` | One name as a positive integer. The whole value must be digits, so `30s` is ignored rather than read as 30. |
| `unsupportedBackendMessage` | `string` | The whole refusal sentence, fixed by the release policy. |
| `unsupportedBackend` | `(value) => string \| undefined` | The refusal, or `undefined` for `sqlite`, empty, and unset. |
| `ambientWorkingDirectory` | `() => string` | The process directory. Belongs only in explicit process-backed service defaults; project operations take their root as an argument. |

## ExecutorOwnership

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ExecutorOwnership` | `Context.Reference<boolean>` | Whether this process drives accepted runs. Defaults to `false`, so a composition that forgets to declare it refuses to wait rather than waiting forever. |
| `layer` | `(ownsExecutor: boolean) => Layer` | Declares it for one command scope. `Application.layer` supplies it from what it actually built. |

## Detached

The `up -d` launch.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admissionVariable` | `"SMITHERS_INTERNAL_DETACHED_ADMISSION"` | The nonce the parent passes to the child. |
| `defaultTimeoutMs` | `30_000` | How long the parent waits for the admission line. |
| `defaultTerminationGraceMs` | `2_000` | How long a terminated child gets before it is killed. |
| `admissionLine` | `(nonce, runId) => string` | The line the child writes once the run row is durable. |
| `admittedRunId` | `(tail, nonce) => string \| undefined` | The run id read back out of a log tail. |
| `logTail` | `(file, maxBytes?) => string` | The end of a log file. |
| `terminate` | `(...) => Promise<...>` | Ends a child that never reached admission. |
| `Launched`, `Rejected`, `Options` | interfaces | The two outcomes of a launch, and its inputs. |
| `launch` | `(options) => Promise<Launched \| Rejected>` | Spawns the child and waits for admission. |
| `isLaunched` | `(result) => result is Launched` | Which outcome it was. |
| `discard` | `(rejected: Rejected) => void` | Cleans up after a rejection. |

## Doctor

Readiness as one report.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Level` | `"ok" \| "warn" \| "fail"` | A `warn` stops nothing; a `fail` will stop the next command. |
| `Check`, `Report` | `{ name, level, detail }`, `{ root, checks }` | The report is data. `--json` prints it verbatim. |
| `minimumNode` | `"22.19.0"` | The floor the durable engine requires. |
| `supportedNodeRange` | `"^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.11.0"` | The Node range supported by the CLI's runtime dependencies. |
| `satisfiesNode` | `(version, minimum?) => boolean` | Whether a Node version is supported and clears an optional higher floor. |
| `Options` | interface | Every host fact is a parameter, so the report is deterministic in a test. |
| `inspect` | `(options) => Report` | Runs every check. |
| `render` | `(report) => string` | One line per check. |
| `failed` | `(report) => boolean` | Whether any check failed, which decides the command's status. |

## Forensics

Read-only projections of a run's events. Nothing here opens a database, so
`--remote` renders exactly what a local run renders.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Refusal` | `{ message, count }` | One refused flow call, aggregated by message. |
| `Digest` | interface | Status, cause, seat, turns, calls, refusals, duplicate calls, edits, tokens, flow counts, parked approval, final output. |
| `digest` | `(events) => Digest` | Computes it. Missing or malformed fields become optional or zero values rather than failing. |
| `renderDiagnosis` | `(run, digest) => string` | The `smthrs status` card: verdict, activity, refusals, cause, and the exact next commands. |
| `eventLine` | `(event) => string` | One follow-mode line. |
| `renderTranscript` | `(events) => string` | The turn-by-turn transcript `smthrs logs` prints. |
| `shellQuote` | `(value) => string` | Quotes a value for the card's copy-paste commands. |

## NodeOutput

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resultNodeId` | `"result"` | The conventional node id of a flow's final output. |
| `Node` | interface | One registered node output. |
| `project` | `(events) => ReadonlyArray<Node>` | The node-output projection of a run's events. |
| `find` | `(...)` | One node by id. |
| `notFound` | `(runId, nodeId, nodes) => string` | The usage message for a node the run does not have. |
| `render` | `(node) => string` | One node's human rendering. |

## McpServer

The stdio MCP server.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocolVersion` | `"2025-06-18"` | The MCP version advertised. |
| `maximumFrameBytes` | `4 MiB` | One request or response frame. |
| `maximumHistoryEvents`, `maximumHistoryBytes` | `10_000`, `1 MiB` | One history result. |
| `Surface` | `"raw" \| "semantic" \| "both"` | Which tool list a session sees. |
| `Envelope` | `{ ok: true, data } \| { ok: false, error: { code, message } }` | The answer every tool gives. |
| `succeeded`, `failed` | constructors | The two envelopes. |
| `Tool` | interface | `name`, `description`, `readOnly`, `schema`, `inputSchema`, `call`. |
| `supportedTools` | `ReadonlyArray<Tool>` | The eleven control-backed tools. |
| `unsupportedReasons`, `unsupportedTools` | | The twelve retired names that answer `unsupported`, and why. |
| `rawTools` | `(verbs) => ReadonlyArray<Tool>` | One directory entry per shipped verb, naming the shell command. Not a second execution path. |
| `Options`, `tools` | `{ surface?, allowedTools?, readOnly?, verbs? }` | The session's scope, and the tools it leaves. |
| `requested` | `(args) => boolean` | Whether `--mcp` was passed. |
| `optionsFromArguments` | `(args) => Options` | The session scope read from raw argv, because MCP clients configure a launch command. |
| `respond` | `(request, session, version) => ...` | Answers one request, or `undefined` for a notification. |
| `serve` | `(options) => Effect` | Serves the session on stdio. |

## Agents

The agent configurations `smthrs mcp add` writes into.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `serverName` | `"smithers"` | The `mcpServers` key written. |
| `Agent`, `agents` | `{ id, mcpConfig }` | `claude` at `~/.claude.json`, `codex` at `~/.codex/mcp.json`. |
| `find` | `(id) => Agent \| undefined` | One agent by id. |
| `launchCommand` | `(execPath?, entry?) => { command, args }` | The current executable and entry, verbatim, so a local development install registers itself rather than a package runner. |
| `Wired` | `{ agent, path, status, reason? }` | What one wiring attempt did. |
| `addMcp` | `(agent, home?) => Wired` | Registers the server, through a lock file and a temp-plus-rename with the mode preserved. |
| `manualInstructions` | `(targets?) => string` | What to do by hand when every write failed. |

## Serve

The gateway bind rule and its banner.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loopbackHosts` | `["127.0.0.1", "::1", "localhost"]` | The addresses that need no opt-in. |
| `defaultBind` | `{ host: "127.0.0.1", port: 3000 }` | The default. |
| `Mount`, `mounts` | `{ protocol, path, serves }` | Every route the gateway hosts, in banner order. The banner is rendered from this list, so it cannot advertise a 404. |
| `isLoopback` | `(host) => boolean` | Whether a host needs the opt-in. |
| `Bind` | `{ host, port, listen, credential }` | What the verb was asked to do. |
| `refuse` | `(bind) => UnsupportedError \| undefined` | The refusal for a bind that is not allowed. Non-loopback needs both `--listen` and a bearer token. |
| `workspaceHash` | `(root) => string` | 16 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the resolved root. The path itself is never published. |
| `health` | `(root) => GatewayServer.Health` | What `GET /health` answers. |
| `banner` | `(bind) => string` | The line printed once the server is listening. |
| `GatewayHost`, `GatewayHostService` | `Context.Service` | The already-composed Node gateway, supplied by the platform composition so serving reuses the open control database. |
| `host` | `(bind, root) => Effect` | Hosts the gateway until the process is interrupted. |

## Init

`smthrs init`.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ignoreRule` | `".flows/"` | The line added to `.gitignore`. |
| `IgnoreStatus` | `"created" \| "updated" \| "unchanged" \| "skipped"` | What happened to that file. |
| `isRepository`, `ensureIgnored` | `(root, ...) => ...` | Whether the directory is a repository, and the ignore write. |
| `nameProblem`, `isValidName` | `(name) => ...` | Why a flow name is rejected, and whether it is. |
| `defaultName` | `(root) => string` | The slug of the project directory, or `flow`. |
| `Seat`, `defaultSeat` | `{ seat, variable, resolved }` | The seat the scaffold declares, chosen from the same provider keys `doctor` reports. A directory with no key still gets a `model:` line, so the launch refuses by naming the key instead of leaving a run nothing drives. |
| `template` | `(name, seat) => string` | The scaffolded `flow.mdx`: markdown, so it needs no build step in the directory `init` just created. |
| `Scaffolded`, `scaffold` | `(root, name, environment) => Scaffolded` | Writes `flows/<name>/flow.mdx` and creates `.flows/`. An existing flow file is left exactly as it is. |

## Suggest

`smthrs suggest`: read the project, stream the ways Smithers can help, and
implement the one the operator picks.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Implementation` | `{ kind, suggestion, followUp?, files, command, notes }` | What one implementation wrote, and which of the three briefs it answered. |
| `Outcome`, `outcomeDocument`, `exitStatus` | | The result of one pass, its `--json` document, and its status: 130 when cancelled, 0 otherwise. |
| `Implement` | `(brief: string) => Effect<Implemented, Error>` | The seam the agent is called through. |
| `Options`, `run` | `(options) => Effect<Outcome, CliError>` | The order the scan, the pick, and the implementation happen in. |
| `isDirectory` | `(path) => boolean` | Whether the target is a directory. |
| `suggestionDocument`, `seatDocument` | | The `--json` documents for one suggestion and the chosen seat. |
| `introLine`, `streamLabel`, `wroteNote` | | The three human lines. |

The implementation writes under the project root and never commits: the grant
store denies `.git/` and `.flows/`, and there is no process-spawn grant at all.

## Providers

Which seats this machine can run.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Candidate`, `order` | | The seats considered, in preference order. |
| `Detection`, `detect` | `(host) => ReadonlyArray<Detection>` | What this machine has, from host facts passed in. |
| `Chosen`, `chooseSeat` | | The seat picked, and why. |
| `compatible`, `compatibleKey` | | The provider compatibility table and its lookup. |
| `defaultSeat` | `Record<Candidate, string>` | The seat string each candidate resolves to. |
| `starterSeats` | `ReadonlyArray<readonly [variable: string, seat: string]>` | Ordered credential-variable and model-seat pairs used by scaffolding, aligned with the executor's supported provider routes. |
| `NoSeatError`, `SeatSyntaxError`, `noSeatMessage` | | The two refusals, and the sentence that names what to set. |

## Gc

Retention.

| Export | Signature | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `defaultRetention` | `"30d"` | The default `--older-than`. |
| `duration` | `(value) => number \| undefined` | A duration string as milliseconds. `0s` is not a retention policy and is refused. |
| `databases` | `(root) => ReadonlyArray<string>` | The files a sweep opens. |
| `Failure`, `failureMessage` | | A database the sweep could not open, and the sentence naming them. |
| `Sweep`, `sweep` | `(root, { olderThan, dryRun }) => Effect<Sweep>` | The pass, and what it deleted or would delete. |

## Memory, mirrors, and credentials

| Module | Export summary |
| --- | --- |
| `Legacy` | `read(path)` opens a 0.x `smithers.db` read-only; `refusal(databases)` is the sentence that names its non-terminal runs; `terminalStatuses` is the vocabulary it counts against. |
| `ClaudeMirror` | The Claude Code plugin mirror protocol: `contract`, `subscriptionsPath`, `subscriptionTtlMs`, `Subscription`, `readSubscriptions`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `MirrorNode`, `Frame`, `frame`, `defaultMaxOutputChars`, `terminalStatuses`, `isTerminal`, `Transition`, `notableKinds`, `transition`. |
| `CodexAuth` | Locates and refreshes the Codex credential store: `refreshUrl`, `clientId`, `locate`, `parse`, `Store`, `MakeOptions`, `make`. |
| `Update` | `packageName`, `registryUrl`, `Status`, `isNewer`, `compare(current, tags)`, `render(status)`. Compares the installed version against the `next` and `latest` dist-tags, `next` first, and prints the install line. It changes nothing. |
| `Bug` | `defaultEndpoint`, `timeoutMs`, `scrubText`, `scrub`, `Report`, `report`. Everything collected takes the journal's redaction rules before it leaves the machine, and a value carrying a callable, a proxy, or a `toJSON` member is refused rather than rendered. |
| `Version` | `packageVersion`, read from the shipped manifest. The module throws at import when the manifest declares no version, because printing `undefined` to an operator is worse than refusing to start. |

## The executable

`@smthrs/cli/bin` is the side-effect entry point. It installs the SIGINT and
SIGTERM handlers, decides between a document, a refusal, the MCP server, and
the command tree, and maps the exit to a process status. The package installs
it as `smthrs`, with `smithers` as an alias.

`@smthrs/cli/cli/LegacyBin` is the retained Effect command tree's entry point.
It runs at import, so `bin` loads it only for a legacy invocation, and the
manifest declares both under `sideEffects` so a bundler keeps them.

## Command documentation

The per-verb reference, with arguments, flags, output, and exit codes, is
generated from the real parser and the release policy and lives on smithers.sh:
[`smthrs plan`](/cli/plan), [`smthrs run`](/cli/run), [`smthrs up`](/cli/up),
and the rest. This page documents the library surface used to compose or embed
that executable.
