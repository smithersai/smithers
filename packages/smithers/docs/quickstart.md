This quickstart takes one directory from empty to a settled run. Every command
here is a real `smthrs` process against one real project.

By the end you will have a project with `.flows/control.db` and
`.flows/engine.db` on disk, one flow discovered from `flows/`, and one durable
run you can list, read, and delete.

## Before you start

Install the CLI and check the machine, as described in
[Installation](./installation.md):

```bash
mkdir hello-smithers && cd hello-smithers
smthrs doctor
```

`doctor` inspects discovery and existing state without creating execution databases. It reports the project root it resolved, both database
files, the supported Node range (26.4.0 or later), whether `jj` is on the
`PATH`, and which provider keys are set. A `fail` line is a fact that will stop
the next command you run; fix those first.

## Scaffold a flow

```bash
smthrs init hello
```

`init` creates workspace declarations, a package manifest when absent, and
`flows/hello/flow.mdx`. Existing declarations are retained. It adds `.flows/`
to `.gitignore` in a repository; execution databases are acquired by runtime
commands, not by generating a flow.

For an existing npm workspace, use the supported flow-only path:

```bash
smthrs generate flow hello
```

This preserves `packageManager` and adds the flow without inventing an npm
workspace executor. `init` refuses an unsupported package manager before
writing project files and points to this command.

The scaffold declares a model seat chosen from the provider credentials this
environment sets, in the order `doctor` reports them:

```text
---
description: A starter Smithers flow.
capabilities: ["fs:read:**", "fs:write:**", "proc:spawn:*"]
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
---
```

The directory supplies the flow's name. The starter requests file reads,
file writes, and process spawning for its editing and testing instructions;
narrow those capabilities when the task needs less authority.

If no provider key was set when `init` ran, the line names the default seat and
the variable to set for it. Set that variable now, because a launch with no
resolvable seat is refused rather than run:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

An agent run also needs `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. The loop's last brake on a
completion asks Jev whether the claim the run wrote matches the evidence the
run produced, and it never falls back, so without the key a run fails at its
first completion with `completion_unjudged`:

```bash
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=vck_...
```

Confirm the flow is discoverable:

```bash
smthrs ls
```

```text
{
  "_tag": "flows",
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "A starter Smithers flow.",
      "flowId": "hello"
    }
  ]
}
```

Members are ordered by UTF-16 code unit in every document the CLI prints, which
is why `description` comes before `flowId`.

## Plan the flow

```bash
smthrs plan hello
```

`plan` creates no run. It asks the control plane to plan the flow and prints
the plan card: the plan id, the content digest, the canonical summary of the
input, the capability envelope, the node graph, and an `approval` member. That
`approval` member is the payload `approve`, `deny`, and `run` accept unchanged.

Capture it for the next two steps:

```bash
approval="$(smthrs --json plan hello | jq -c '.approval')"
```

## Submit it, and watch it park

```bash
smthrs run "$approval"
echo "exit: $?"
```

```text
{"_tag":"Parked","planId":"<plan-id>","receiptId":"<receipt-id>","status":"waiting-approval"}
exit: 3
```

The plan carries no grant yet, so the control plane parks it instead of
launching. Exit 3 is the one outcome a caller cannot read from the payload
alone: the run did not fail, it is waiting for a decision.

## Approve it, then run it

```bash
smthrs approve "$approval" --scope run
```

```text
{"_tag":"Accepted","receiptId":"approve:plan-1"}
```

`approve` records the grant. It does not launch: the receipt carries no
`runId`, and `smthrs ps` still lists nothing. Submit the same payload again,
and this time the grant is there:

```bash
smthrs run "$approval"
echo "exit: $?"
```

`--scope run` grants this launch and the whole run it starts, which is the same
grant `smthrs up` makes for itself. `once` grants a single ask, and
`remembered` grants every later run.

Because this process owns the executor, `run` stays attached after the receipt
is accepted, waits for the run to settle, and reports the run's outcome as its
own exit status: 0 for `completed`, 1 for `failed`, 130 for `cancelled`, 3 if
it parks again on an in-run ask.

With no resolvable provider credential the launch is refused rather than left
hanging, and the run row settles `failed`:

```text
LaunchFailed: Set OPENAI_API_KEY to run the openai:gpt-6-sol seat
```

## Read the run back

```bash
smthrs ps
```

`ps` lists durable runs with their status, and `--status` filters on the seven
statuses the release pins: `accepted`, `running`, `parked`,
`waiting-approval`, `cancelled`, `completed`, and `failed`. An eighth value is
a usage error, not an empty list.

Take the run id from that listing and read what happened:

```bash
smthrs status <run-id>     # the diagnosis card: what it did, and what to do next
smthrs logs <run-id>       # the transcript; --json is the raw event stream
smthrs output <run-id>     # every registered node output
```

`logs --follow` streams events as they land instead of rendering a transcript.
`output <run-id> <node-id>` prints one node's output; a node id the run does
not have is a usage error naming the run, not an empty document.

## Do it in one command next time

The plan, approve, run sequence collapses into one verb when the plan needs no
human review:

```bash
smthrs up hello --data '{"args":"Describe how durable runs work"}'
```

`up` plans the flow, grants the plan's own approval at `run` scope, and submits
it. Attached, it waits for the run to settle and exits with the run's status.
With `-d` it launches a child process that outlives it and prints the run id
and log path instead. See [Launch a detached run](./guides/launch-a-detached-run.md).

## Clean up

```bash
smthrs down                            # cancel every non-terminal run
smthrs gc --older-than 1s --dry-run    # report what retention would delete
smthrs gc --older-than 1s              # delete it
```

`down` is a list followed by a cancel, so running it twice is a no-op rather
than an error. `gc` refuses `--older-than 0s`: deleting everything is not a
retention policy, and it is the easiest value to type by accident.

## What just happened

One project directory anchored every command on the same two SQLite files, so
the run `run` started is the run `ps` listed and `gc` deleted. The approval you
passed to `run` and `approve` was the same serialized payload `plan` printed,
which is why another local operator process or explicitly delegated remote
operator can decide a park this shell created. The MCP surface can inspect
pending approvals but refuses approval and denial decisions.

## Next steps

- [Script the CLI](./guides/script-the-cli.md): `--json`, exit codes, and the
  idempotency keys that make a retried command safe.
- [Diagnose a run](./guides/diagnose-a-run.md): what `status`, `logs`, and
  `output` each answer, and how to file a bug with a run digest attached.
- [Output and exit codes](./concepts/output-and-exit-codes.md): the rendering
  rules and the status vocabulary a script branches on.
