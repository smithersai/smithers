/**
 * The revision a host's sources were read from.
 *
 * A plan card and a run's journal both carry where each node was declared —
 * a path and a line inside the workspace — and a reader opens that file to
 * see the code the node runs. The path alone does not say WHICH bytes: the
 * working tree moves under the host, and a file read after an edit or a
 * branch switch is a different file at the same address. This module answers
 * the missing half: an immutable name for the tree the host read its flows
 * out of, which a content route can be asked to serve by.
 *
 * Two version-control systems can answer it, and they are not equally able:
 *
 *   - `jj` commits the working copy on every command, so `@`'s commit id
 *     names the tree INCLUDING uncommitted work, and the id stays readable
 *     after the working copy has moved on. That is the whole answer.
 *   - `git` names only what was committed. A tree with any change — staged,
 *     unstaged or untracked, and a new flow file is untracked — is not
 *     described by `HEAD`, so a dirty git checkout answers NOTHING rather
 *     than a commit that does not hold the bytes that were loaded.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a revision. A host with neither tool, a tool that
 * fails, or a git tree that has moved answers `undefined`, which the readers
 * downstream state as an absent Code tab rather than a file they cannot
 * bind.
 *
