 * A replaceable HTTP transport over Undici, given a way to acquire a dispatcher.

 * `RequestExecutor` asks a host for two things: the client to use now, and an
 * effect that builds another. A retry ladder repairs a failure by
 * waiting and a destroyed HTTP/2 session is the failure waiting does not
 * repair. Undici's dispatcher *is* the connection pool, so on Node the
 * replacement is a new one.
 *
 * Each dispatcher is acquired in a scope forked off the caller's, and the
 * previous scope is closed the moment the next dispatcher is in hand, so a run
 * that rebuilds many times still holds exactly one pool and the caller's own
 * teardown closes the last of them. The *first* client is built by this same
 * code rather than taken from `NodeHttpClient.layerUndici`, so the client the
 * executor starts on and the client a rebuild produces are made the same way
 * and owned the same way.
 *
 * `acquire` is a parameter so a test can hand it a scripted dispatcher; the
 * production caller passes `environmentDispatcher(process.env)`.
