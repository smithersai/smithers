/**
 * The Node host the workspace walk runs on.
 *
 * `WorkspaceObservation.fileSystemHost` spends two Effect `FileSystem` calls
 * on every entry: `readLink`, which fails with an error value on every regular
 * file, then `stat`. On this repository that was 3.4–5 s a measurement, twice
 * a frame, and a one-line `ctx.done()` answer reached the TUI 8 s after the
 * model wrote it. This host reads each entry's type off the directory listing,
 * so directories and symlinks cost no call at all, and measures a directory's
 * files with concurrent `lstat`s. `lstat` never follows a link, so the walk's
 * "a symlink is not part of the tree" rule holds without asking twice.
 *
 * Errors carry the tags Effect's own Node `FileSystem` gives them, so the walk
 * reads a vanished path and a denied one exactly as it does on the portable host.
