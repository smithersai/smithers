/**
 * What a failure that carries no sentence still owes an operator.
 *
 * Every `@smthrs/control` failure is a `Schema.TaggedError` whose data lives in
 * named fields. Some override `message` with a sentence — `NoMatchingWait`
 * does, and says why: "every other renderer in the tree prints `message`, so a
 * refusal with none is a refusal with no reason". The rest have none, and the
 * executable's reporter printed the class name and a bare colon for them:
 * `smthrs resume` against a run another process owns answered the whole line
 * `ClaimLost: `, which names neither the run nor the stable `code` a script
 * must be able to grep for.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `cli/LegacyBin.ts` because importing that module runs the
 * command line: the reporter itself can only be exercised through a real
 * process, and this is the part of it that has an answer to check.
