/**
 * `smthrs suggest`: read the project, stream the ways Smithers can help, and
 * implement the one the operator picks.
 *
 * The verb is the composition of four modules that already exist and are
 * tested on their own: `Providers` decides which seat this machine can run,
 * `suggest/Checklist` reads the repository and yields one suggestion per
 * match, `suggest/Brief` turns a match into the text the agent is handed, and
 * `suggest/SuggestFlow` runs that text through a kernel-guarded filesystem
 * pinned to the project root. Nothing here reads a file or spends a token
 * itself; this module is the order those four happen in and the shape of what
 * an operator sees.
 *
 * Three renderings, one scan. `--json` writes one document per suggestion as
 * it is found, then the seat and the outcome, and never asks a question.
 * `--list`, and any session whose streams are not terminals, prints the same
 * suggestions as lines and stops there. An interactive session prints them
 * while a spinner says the scan continues, then asks which one to implement,
 * implements it, and offers that suggestion's follow-ups and the large
 * suggestions the checklist held back.
 *
 * Every side effect an operator did not ask for is a side effect they have to
 * undo, so the implementation writes files under the project root and never
 * commits: `SuggestFlow.rules` denies `.git/` and `.flows/` in the grant
 * store, and there is no `proc:spawn` grant at all.
 *
