 * `smthrs up -d`: launch a run in a process that outlives this one.

 * launch returns only after the child has *proved* it persisted the run row,
 * never on spawn success. A launcher that returns on spawn reports a run id
 * for a process that may already have died on a missing credential, and the
 * operator finds out minutes later from an empty `ps`.
 *
 * The child writes one line to its own log the moment the control plane hands
 * back an `Accepted` receipt (see {@link admissionLine}). The line is the
 * wake-up; the proof is the run row. The log is the child's whole
 * stdout/stderr, which every tool, agent and shell the run spawns shares, and
 * those processes inherit the nonce, so any id in the log is a claim, not a
 * fact. The parent asks its own control store, through
 * {@link Options.admission}, whether each announced id is a run row that
 * belongs to this launch, and only then renames the log onto the run id and
 * prints the receipt. A child that exits before an announced id is confirmed,
 * or that is still unconfirmed at the deadline, is reported as a failed launch
 * with the log's tail attached.
