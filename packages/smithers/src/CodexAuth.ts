/**
 * ChatGPT-subscription credentials for the OpenAI provider, read from the
 * codex CLI's auth store — `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, `~/.codex/auth.json` by
 * default. `flows` shares the store rather than owning one: `codex login`
 * provisions it, either client may refresh it, and a rewrite here preserves
 * every field codex expects so codex keeps working afterwards.
 *
 * The store implements the model layer's `Auth` contract. `sign` reads the
 * file fresh on every attempt, refreshes proactively when the access token's
 * JWT `exp` is inside the expiry margin, and emits the bearer plus the
 * `chatgpt-account-id` header. `refresh` is the reactive half `Route.stream`
 * runs after a 401. Both funnel into one single-flight section that re-reads
 * the file before spending the refresh token, because codex may have rotated
 * it first and OAuth refresh tokens are not guaranteed reusable.
 *
 * Refresh traffic goes through the composed `RequestExecutor`, never a bare
 * fetch, so the executor's retry ladder and credential redaction apply to the
 * token endpoint exactly as they do to model calls. No token, account id, or
 * endpoint response ever enters an error message, a log, or a journal: errors
 * name the file path and the endpoint, nothing else.
 *
 * Confirmed against the live backend and codex v0.149.1 on 2026-08-25: the
 * refresh endpoint, client id, scope, response shape, and auth.json layout.
