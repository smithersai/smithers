/**
 * Diagnostics go to stderr, so stdout carries only the document.
 *
 * `report` above already keeps CLI failures off stdout, but the runtime logger
 * is the other writer. A run's own lifecycle warnings, `An agent run failed`
 * and its rendered cause, are logged by `@smthrs/agent` through the default
 * logger, which calls `console.log`. Under `--json` that put forty lines of
 * warning inside the one document an attached launch prints, so a pipeline
 * step parsing `smthrs up <flow> --json` read a syntax error instead of the
 * receipt it was promised (the release policy, the `up` row). `LogToStderr`
 * is the reference Effect provides for exactly this: keep stdout for protocol
 * output and send every built-in logger to `console.error`.
 *
 * `RedactedLogger.layer` then puts every one of those lines through the rules
 * `@smthrs/journal` applies on the write path, so a credential an action hands
 * to `Effect.logInfo` no longer reaches the operator's terminal, the
 * `--json` stderr stream, or `.flows/logs/<runId>.log` under a detached
 * launch (the release policy). The durable engine installs the same layer
 * beneath itself, and wrapping is idempotent, so a detached `smthrs run`
 * pays the rules once.
