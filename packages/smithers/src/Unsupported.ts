/**
 * The removal surface for 0.x commands and flags.
 *
 * A verb that 0.x had and rc.0 does not must fail with a sentence that names
 * the replacement, not with a usage error. `effect/unstable/cli` answers an
 * unknown subcommand with exit 2 and a "did you mean" list, which tells an
 * operator nothing about why `smthrs rewind` stopped existing. So every
 * removed verb is registered as a hidden subcommand whose only behaviour is
 * to fail with {@link message}, and every removed flag is declared hidden on
 * the command that used to carry it.
 *
 * The tables below are the contract. `test/Verb.test.ts` pins the verb set and
 * `test/Bin.test.ts` pins the flags, so a verb cannot quietly reappear and a
 * flag cannot quietly become a usage error again.
