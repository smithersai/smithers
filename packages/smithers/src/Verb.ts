/**
 * The retained Effect CLI handlers in `smthrs` 1.0.0-rc.0.
 *
 * At the import reference this module projected `SystemFlows.catalog`
 * directly, so eleven verbs existed only as bodiless reserved flows that
 * planned and exited 0. The CLI contract forbids that partial
 * appearance: a verb either ships with a handler (the shipped-command contract, {@link shipped})
 * or is removed and says so (the removed-command contract, `Unsupported.removedVerbs`).
 *
 * This table is the authority for those handlers, and `test/Verb.test.ts` pins
 * it. `Cli.makeCli` registers the canonical public Incur command tree, including
 * target commands and the `flow`, `runs`, and `approvals` groups. The reserved
 * flow ids that survive are still named here so a catalog change cannot
 * silently desynchronise the compatibility handlers and the control catalog.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
