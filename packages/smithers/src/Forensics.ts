/**
 * Read-only forensic projections of a run's journal events.
 *
 * The vault's Forensics concept fixes the CLI surface at exactly two
 * projections: `smthrs logs` projects journal queries and `smthrs status`
 * projects the run summary and its gating cause. This module is the rendering
 * half of both: pure functions from the `ControlEvent` deltas that
 * `Control.watch` already serves, to a turn-by-turn transcript, a one-line
 * follow view, and the status card's diagnosis. Nothing here opens a
 * database; the control plane stays the only read path, so `--remote` renders
 * exactly what a local run renders.
 *
 * The need is concrete: the first SWE-bench benchmark of the built-in harness
 * was diagnosed with ad-hoc SQLite scripts because a settled run's journal
 * had no readable projection. Every question those scripts answered, where
 * the turns went, which calls were refused and why, whether an edit was ever
 * attempted, and what the run died of, is computed here from the events alone.
