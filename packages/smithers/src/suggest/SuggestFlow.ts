/**
 * The bundled flow `smthrs suggest` runs to implement one suggestion, and the
 * Node composition it runs under.
 *
 * One model-backed step: the brief in, an {@link Implemented} out. The agent
 * writes through the standard filesystem flows over a kernel-guarded
 * filesystem pinned to the project root, with no shell, so the promise the
 * verb makes ("writes files and never commits") is enforced by the grant
 * store rather than asserted by a prompt sentence: `.git/` and `.flows/` are
 * denied, every other path under the root is allowed, and nothing else
 * exists.
 *
 * The composition mirrors `@smthrs/migrate`'s `Layers`: the deterministic
 * half (the scan) never enters here, the credentialed half runs through the
 * CLI's own seat resolver so the seat this verb chose is exactly a seat
 * `smthrs up` can run, and a scripted composition replaces only the model.
