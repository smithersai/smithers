/**
 * The public command-line projection for flows.
 *
 * Every top-level module under `src/` is exported here and is also reachable
 * as `@smthrs/cli/<Module>`. The modules under `src/cli/`, `src/evaluation/`,
 * `src/history/`, `src/operator/`, and `src/suggest/` that `package.json`
 * exports are subpath-only: `@smthrs/cli/<dir>/<Module>` resolves, and no
 * namespace here does. `test/Readme.test.ts` compares `README.md` against
 * both lists: its table against these namespaces and their runtime exports,
 * and its subpath-only section against the nested export map, so a module
 * that reaches one spelling and not the other fails the suite.
