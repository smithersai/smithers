/**
 * The package's own entry point, loaded through its export map the way
 * `apps/review` loads it.
 *
 * `apps/review` imports this package under Node ESM, where a relative specifier
 * without an extension does not resolve. `tests/generatedThemes.test.ts` guards
 * that discipline for `src/themes/*` only, and the barrel's own specifiers were
 * checked nowhere in this package -- an extension dropped from `src/index.ts`
 * surfaced two packages away, in `apps/review/tests/nodeRuntimeResolution.test.ts`.
 *
 * The suite itself runs under Bun, which resolves extensionless specifiers, so
 * this has to be a real Node process. `process.execPath` is not that process:
 * under this package's only runner it is `bun`, and a child spawned from it
 * would have passed this test with the extensions removed. The binary comes
 * from `tests/nodeBinary.ts`, and the first assertion proves what it launched.
