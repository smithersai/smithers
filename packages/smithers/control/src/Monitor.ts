 * | No summary | `unknown` | Nothing to say, and nothing to do. |
 * | `failed` | `failing` | The run itself reported the failure. |
 * | `completed`, `cancelled` | `healthy` | A finished run needs nothing. |
 * | `waiting-approval`, or parked on `approval` | `awaiting-human` | A human owes it an answer; no machine can supply one. |
 * | Parked with no waiting reason | `awaiting-human` | Only an operator's own park writes no waiting reason, so a person stopped it and a person restarts it. |
 * | `roundOrdinal` at or past the bound | `runaway-loop` | The lineage is looping without converging. |
 * | The last settled attempt failed | `failing` | The run is still alive but its work is not landing. |
 * | No progress for `stallBeats`, an attempt open | `wedged-node` | One attempt started and never settled: the work is stuck, not the run. |
 * | No progress for `stallBeats` | `stalled` | Nothing is happening and nothing is in flight. |
 * | Anything else | `healthy` | Entries are still arriving. |
 *
 * `awaiting-human` deliberately outranks `failing`: a run parked for approval
 * after a failed attempt is waiting for a person, and resuming or cancelling
 * it would take the decision away from them.
 *
 * A park with no reason is the same case. The engine names every park it makes
 * — `event`, `approval`, `timer`, `quota`, `released` — so a parked run whose
 * `waitingReason` is absent was parked by an operator through
 * `ControlRuntime.writeStatus`. Calling that a stall and resuming it would undo
