 * smoke: three `cancel` calls and one `down` against one parked run left four).

 * is the honest answer for a run another composition launched into a database
 * this one does not share. A {@link CancelTerminal} means the engine row has
 * already settled, so there is nothing left to stop: recording intent on it
