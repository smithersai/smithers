/**
 * Control-plane contracts and projections for the Smithers harness.
 *
 * This is the public surface of the control plane: the transport-independent
 * `Control` service, the `ControlRuntime` port it writes through, the
 * projections it reads back, and the durable adapter that binds both to a real
 * database.
 *
 * `Control` is authority, not execution. Every mutation it accepts is
 * idempotent, principal-stamped, and recorded in the journal beside the state
 * change it caused, so "who asked for this, and when did it take effect?" is
 * answered from persisted evidence rather than from a log line.
