/** A session health checker that asks Jev whether an agent is waiting on a person.
 *
 * Jev, TypeSafe's decision model, reads a state and answers typed questions
 * about it in about 300 ms. It writes no text, so it can never name an option
 * the question did not offer, and the questions in one request are answered in
 * parallel, so a second question costs no latency. The web app already asks it
 * through `apps/server/src/jev.ts`; the engine runs outside the Worker, so this
 * module is the same wire contract written with plain `fetch`.
 *
 * The state is the session's own lifecycle plus the newest bytes of its output.
 * The answer is a `ProbeReport` and nothing else: a checker's output never
 * authorizes a control mutation. There is no fallback. An unconfigured key and
 * an unreachable, refused, slow, or unreadable gateway fail the probe with a
 * {@link JevProbeError}, which `Health.evaluate` records as reason
 * `probe-error`; a stale `probe-error` never establishes activity and never
 * reads healthy. A host that binds `jev.session` is asserting Jev answers for
 * it, and a silent degrade would let that host page nobody while believing it
 * was watched.
 *
 * Two cases are not Jev failing. A session that is no longer alive and a
 * session whose output tail the host did not expose leave nothing to ask about,
 * so they keep the lifecycle answer. An answer below
 * {@link jevConfidenceFloor} is Jev's own decision that it does not know, and
 * stays `unknown`.
