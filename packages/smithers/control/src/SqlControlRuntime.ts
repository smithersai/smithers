/**
 * Durable `ControlRuntime` over `@smthrs/journal`'s fenced `RunStore` and a
 * SQL database.
 *
 * `layerMemory` models the production seams but keeps everything in a `Map`, so
 * nothing it decides survives the process. This adapter supplies the durable
 * boundary the header of `ControlRuntime` describes.
 *
 * ## Where ownership lives
 *
 * The run lifecycle is not re-implemented here. `RunStore` already owns it, and
 * it is the piece that is hard to get right: every ownership move is a single
 * SQL compare-and-swap, so a stale writer loses the `UPDATE` rather than
 * racing a read-then-write. This module maps the control plane's vocabulary
 * onto it:
 *
 * | control status | `RunStore` status | ownership |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `accepted`, `running` | `running` | held by this process |
 * | `accepted` after an executor declines | `suspended` | released |
 * | `parked`, `waiting-approval` | `suspended` | released |
 * | `cancelled` / `completed` / `failed` | same | released, terminal |
 *
 * The authoritative `RunSummary` is written into the row's `state_json` by the
 * same fenced `UPDATE` that moves the status, so a projection can never be read
 * out of step with the lifecycle. `RunStore` has no list operation, so
 * `control_runs` is kept as a plain id index and each summary is read back
 * through the store rather than duplicated.
 *
 * ## Fences
 *
 * A fence is a serialized `OwnerId`. `hostId` and `pid` identify the process;
 * the `nonce` is regenerated on **every** claim, so a fence taken before a
 * park is not the fence held after the resume that follows it, and the stale
 * one is refused by the CAS. This is the `rangeID`-style monotonic fence from
 * `reference/temporal`'s history service, narrowed to a per-run token.
 *
 * ## Browser safety
 *
 * Nothing here imports `node:*`. Identity comes from `globalThis.crypto`, and
 * persistence is the driver-neutral SQL contract, so this module runs anywhere
 * `@smthrs/database` has a driver. Fibers are the exception and are
 * deliberately process-local: a fiber is a live continuation, not a row, and
 * cancellation is interruption of the fiber that this process owns.
 *
