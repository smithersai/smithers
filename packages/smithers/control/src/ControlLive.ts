             * committed entries with no signal, which turns this follow into a
             * permanently incomplete stream. Sequence numbers are
             * partition-local, so each tail entry is checked against the last
             * sequence this watcher saw for its partition (or the snapshot
             * cutoff for one it has not tailed yet).
             *
             * A gap is not proof of loss on its own: a rolled-back transaction
             * leaves an allocated sequence unused, and that hole is benign. The
             * durable journal disambiguates — an entry in the gap that was
             * committed but never delivered here is a real loss and fails the
             * stream, while a hole with no durable entry is skipped.
             *
             * One limitation, by design: the disambiguation reads the durable
             * journal, so an entry that was committed, dropped, and then
             * compacted away before the check runs reports as a benign hole.
             * Closing that needs a registered reader cursor, which the
