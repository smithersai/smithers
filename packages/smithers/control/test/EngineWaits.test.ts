/**
 * Control requests against a run the ENGINE owns: a resume, and a signal.
 *
 * Both defects are the same mistake from two directions. The control plane
 * assumed every run in the database was one it had launched, so `resume`
 * claimed an engine-created run under the control fence — overwriting the
 * engine's own `state_json` and owner columns, after which the engine's
 * `scheduleResume` no longer recognized the row and the run stayed `suspended`
 * with its waiting reason set forever (control-plane example 38, triage B-10).
 * And `signal` recorded a `control_run_messages` row that nothing read, so a
 * flow parked on `WaitFor.action` was never woken by the verb whose whole job
 * is to wake it (triage B-13).
 *
 * The engine here is the real durable one over real SQLite, sharing one
 * database with the control plane, because the claim under test is about two
 * writers of one row.
