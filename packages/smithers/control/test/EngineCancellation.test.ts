/**
 * Cancellation attribution over a cancellation the ENGINE actually performed.
 *
 * `ControlCancellation` drives the projection with rows and journal entries a
 * test wrote, which proves the fold and nothing about the contract: the
 * `flows.engine.interrupted` record and the cascade onto a child both belong
 * to `@smthrs/engine-store`, and a payload key renamed there would leave a
 * hand-written fixture green. This suite runs a real flow that starts a real
 * child, interrupts the parent through `Flow.interrupt`, and asks the control
 * plane who cancelled what.
