/**
 * A question parked on a nested execution, answered from the run an operator
 * knows about.
 *
 * On Smithers Cloud, `run-3` of `coding/request` asked a person a
 * clarifying question through `HumanTask` and then parked forever. The park
 * landed on `coding/PreparePlan`, four `.child()` boundaries below the run the
 * product shows, so:
 *
 * - `Control.list` with `status: "waiting-approval"` returned nothing, and the
 *   approvals inbox said "No approvals are pending" while the run card said
 *   "WAITING FOR EVENT";
 * - `Signal` addressed to `run-3` failed `/control/NoMatchingWait`, because
 *   the delivery bridge read the root's own waiting row and found an `event`
 *   wait that no signal named.
 *
 * Both are the same mistake: a run tree was asked a question about one row.
 * This suite is that tree, over the real durable engine and the real control
 * plane sharing one database.
