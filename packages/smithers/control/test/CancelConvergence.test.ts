/**
 * The end of a cross-owner cancel: what the operator sees once the owner acts.
 *
 * `TerminalControl.test.ts` proves the request half — a cancel from a
 * composition that does not own the run answers `Accepted` and writes
 * `cancel_requested_at_ms` on the engine row. This file proves the other half
 * against the real durable engine: the owner observes that column on its next
 * cancel poll (`Ownership.heartbeatInterval`, one second) and settles the run,
 * and the control plane's own projection of the run moves to `cancelled` with
 * it (triage B-10 and B-11).
 *
 * One database is this file's test layering, not the product's shape. The
 * shipped CLI keeps two: `.flows/control.db` holds the control plane's
 * `flows_runs` row and `.flows/engine.db` holds the engine's, so one run has
 * two rows in two files. They converge because the cancel is recorded durably
 * on the ENGINE row through the `requestCancel` port and the owning driver
 * settles from that request at its next tick; nothing projects one row onto
 * the other. Here both halves share one database, which is why the case can
 * assert the engine row and the control projection in one read — and why it
 * proves the convergence rather than the impossibility of divergence.
 *
 * Separately constructed SQL runtimes mint distinct default identities, so a
 * second runtime cannot write through the first runtime's fence. The shipped
 * CLI supplies its real host and pid identity as well, which also enables
 * same-host liveness probes.
 *
 * The `Flow.execute` fiber's own settlement after a cross-driver cancel is a
 * separate defect (triage N-09, `RunDriver.ts`, the cancel-durability lane), so
 * this case reads the row rather than joining the fiber and interrupts the
 * fiber at the end the way `packages/smithers/flows/test/NodeRuntime.test.ts` does.
