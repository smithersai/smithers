/**
 * The runtime class of every published subpath, proved by bundling it.
 *
 * A scaffolded app splits this package across three hosts. `routes.ui.gen.ts`
 * pulls `./app` and `./ui` into the browser bundle; the aomi template's
 * Cloudflare Worker imports `./runtime` at value level and the default
 * template's imports `./worker`; `./router`, `./vite`,
 * `./package`, and `./testing` are Node-only build and test tooling. Nothing
 * held that split: `scripts/browser-check.mjs` enumerates the repository's
 * frozen browser contract and this package is in neither its BROWSER_SAFE nor
 * its NODE_ONLY inventory, so a `node:` builtin arriving through
 * `@smthrs/engine` or `@smthrs/agent` would break scaffolded Workers with no
 * gate firing.
 *
 * Each assertion names the builtin it expects rather than only asserting that
 * a build failed, so an entry point that starts failing for a NEW reason is a
 * test failure rather than a silent pass.
