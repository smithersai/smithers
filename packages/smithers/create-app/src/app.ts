 *   and {@link defineTools}.
 * - `flows/<id>/flow.ts` exports `Flow` built by {@link defineFlow}. A flow
 *   never names a model; its seat comes from the resolved `AGENT.ts`.
 * - `app/**\/page.tsx` and `app/panes/<name>.tsx` are the UI, resolved by
 *   `@smthrs/create-app/router`.
 * - The rule: file location alone names the thing, and each layer kind
 *   resolves to its nearest ancestor. Nothing merges.
