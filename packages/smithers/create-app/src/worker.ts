/**
 * The turn host a scaffolded Worker serves `POST /api/turn` with.
 *
 * {@link turnResponse} takes the request, resolves the routed chat flow, checks
 * the host can run it, and answers with an NDJSON stream of `TurnFrame` lines:
 * model text as `delta`, each cell the agent ran as `cell`, each host call as
 * `call`, each card a tool painted as `card`, then exactly one `done` or
 * `error`, then close. A request the host cannot run is refused before any
 * stream opens, in one typed JSON body.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches a Node builtin. Seats resolve over `fetch`, digests come
 * from WebCrypto, and the QuickJS build is the caller's: workerd compiles only
 * a WebAssembly module its toolchain bundled, so a Worker imports the `.wasm`
 * module and passes the variant built from it as `sandboxVariant`.
 *
 * A turn is one request, so it runs on the in-memory flow engine. Nothing
 * resumes a half-finished turn; a client that wants continuity replays its
 * history into the next payload.
