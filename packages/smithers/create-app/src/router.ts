/**
 * The file router: a filesystem walk that turns an app directory into a route
 * table and renders the two generated files.
 *
 * Nothing here evaluates a module, so the same code runs under plain Node in
 * `bin/routes.mjs`, inside the Vite plugin, and inside a test. The rules are
 * the whole authoring contract, and file location is the only thing that names
 * anything:
 *
 * - `<app>/layout.tsx` is the shell layout, and it is optional. Only the app
 *   root's `layout.tsx` is a shell layout: a nested one is an ordinary file the
 *   router ignores.
 * - `<app>/**\/page.tsx` is the page at `/<dir>`; `<app>/page.tsx` is `/`. Every
 *   directory segment of that route is a route name, so each one must match
 *   {@link RouterErrorCode} `invalid_name`'s lowercase kebab-case grammar.
 * - `<app>/panes/<name>.tsx` is the pane `<name>`, and only at that exact
 *   depth: `<app>/panes/<dir>/page.tsx` is the page `/panes/<dir>`.
 * - `<flows>/**\/flow.ts` or `flow.mdx` is the flow named by its directory, so
 *   `flows/build/plan/flow.ts` is the flow `build/plan`.
 * - `AGENT.ts`, `SANDBOX.ts`, and `TOOLS.ts` are layers for every flow in
 *   their directory and below. The nearest ancestor of each kind wins and
 *   nothing merges, so the app root must provide all three for resolution to
 *   terminate.
 *
 * Symbolic links are neither walked nor routed, so a checkout's dangling or
 * self-referential links cannot fail or wedge a route generation.
