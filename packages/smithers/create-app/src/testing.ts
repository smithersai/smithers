/**
 * Run one routed flow against a recorded model fixture.
 *
 * The flow id is a string, so nothing infers the output type: state it, or
 * `output` is `unknown` and `expect` cannot read a field.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Flow } from "../flows/chat/flow.ts"
 *
 * cachedModelTest<{ message: string }, typeof Flow.output.Type>(
 *   "chat answers a balance question",
 *   {
 *     fixture: new URL("./fixtures/balance.json", import.meta.url),
 *     flow: "chat",
 *     payload: { message: "What is vitalik.eth's balance?" },
 *     expect: (output) => { expect(output.answer).toContain("ETH") }
 *   }
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Two modes, one call site. Replay is the default: the fixture is decoded with
 * `@smthrs/testing`'s `Fixture` schema and served by `RecordedModel`, with no
 * network and no API key. Recording (`SMTHRS_RECORD=1`) builds the live model
 * from `options.live`, captures every request and event through
 * {@link recordModel}, and rewrites the fixture after the run.
 *
 * `vitest` is an optional peer: only this module needs it.
