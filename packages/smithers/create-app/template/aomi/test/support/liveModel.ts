/**
 * The live seat a recording run streams from: `<provider>:<model>` over the
 * platform's `fetch`, credentialed from the provider's environment variable.
 *
 * This is the credentialed half of `worker/seats.ts` with the Worker's env
 * binding replaced by `process.env` and the `Seat` wrapper dropped, because
 * `cachedModelTest`'s `live` option asks for a bare `Model.Model` and builds
 * the seat itself. The duplication is deliberate. Importing `worker/seats.ts`
 * here would pull the Worker's env type and `@smthrs/agent`'s seat machinery
 * into a vitest process that needs neither, and the test would break the
 * moment the Worker's env grew a field that has nothing to do with models.
 *
 * Two providers are credentialed here because the app has run on both. The
 * machine that records a fixture supplies one key, the seat in AGENT.ts names
 * the matching provider, and the other branch stays live for the machine that
 * has the other key.
 *
 * Nothing in this module runs during replay. `pnpm test` decodes the committed
 * fixture and serves it with `RecordedModel`, so it reads no key and opens no
 * socket. Only `SMTHRS_RECORD=1` reaches this file.
