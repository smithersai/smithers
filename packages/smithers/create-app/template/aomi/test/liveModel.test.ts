/**
 * The recording seat's credential source.
 *
 * `liveModel` runs only under `SMTHRS_RECORD=1`, so a replayed `pnpm test`
 * never reaches it and a wrong switch name stays hidden until someone records.
 * `SMITHERS_OPENAI_AUTH=chatgpt` is the spelling the CLI and its docs give the
 * ChatGPT-subscription credential. This module used to read a pre-rename
 * `FLOWS_OPENAI_AUTH`, so an operator who set the documented variable was asked
 * for an `OPENAI_API_KEY` they had deliberately left unset.
