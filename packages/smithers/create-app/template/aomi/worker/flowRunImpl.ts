/**
 * One pipeline flow run, projected onto a single `flow-run` card.
 *
 * `POST /api/flows/run` answers with an execution id and nothing else, so this
 * is where the run's progress becomes visible. The run is `runFlow` from
 * `@smthrs/create-app/worker` on the host `./host.ts` builds; each card the
 * flow paints is persisted as it streams, and the run's own card is replaced
 * once it settles. `AppSession` persists each version under the card's id, so
 * `GET /api/session?id=` always returns the latest one.
 *
 * The card id is the execution id. A run therefore owns exactly one card for
 * its whole life, which is what makes `card.update` the right frame: the shell
 * replaces a card it already has rather than growing the transcript per step.
