/**
 * The app's API: a switch over `Routes` from `src/api.ts`, which is the one
 * place the browser and the Worker agree on a path.
 *
 * Everything the switch does not claim falls through to the assets binding, so
 * a deep link into the SPA is served by the static bucket and not by a handler
 * that has to know about it. `run_worker_first` in `wrangler.jsonc` is scoped
 * to `/api/*` for the same reason: no asset request wakes this code.
 *
 * Session state lives in one Durable Object per `sessionId`. The turn route
 * forwards to it and streams the object's own NDJSON body straight back, so
 * frames reach the browser as the agent writes them.
 *
 * This module is deliberately separate from `index.ts`: `index.ts` exports the
 * Durable Object class and therefore imports `cloudflare:workers`, which only
 * workerd resolves. Keeping the routing here lets `test/worker.test.ts` call
 * {@link handle} with stub bindings on plain Node.
 *
 * ## What bounds a deployed instance
 *
 * `CreateApp` ships `deploy` as a first-class target with a custom domain, so
 * read this before you point one at it. Request checks run ahead of the routes;
 * `worker/guard.ts` owns them:
 *
 * - **Credential.** `APP_API_TOKEN` is a Worker secret. Every `/api/*` path
 *   but `GET /api/health` requires its bearer header. Missing or empty tokens
 *   refuse requests unless local development opts in with `APP_API_OPEN=1`.
 *   Health does not disclose authentication configuration.
 * - **Browser origin.** Present Origin and Sec-Fetch-Site headers must identify
 *   the same origin, including in local open mode.
 * - **Media type.** JSON routes require `Content-Type: application/json`.
 * - **Size.** Every JSON body is read through a 64 KiB cap and answers 413 past
 *   it, whether or not the request declared a `content-length`.
 * - **Identity.** A session id is a flat identifier of at most 128 characters,
 *   and never the registry object's own name, so a caller can neither address
 *   `INDEX_SESSION` as a session nor name an object with arbitrary text.
 *
 * What is still unbounded: per-session Durable Object storage, model spend, and
 * request rate. One shared token is one tenant, not tenancy: a holder of the
 * token reaches every session. `worker/README.md` says the same in its Security
 * section.
