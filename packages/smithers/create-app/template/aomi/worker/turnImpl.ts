 * the agent paints come back over the same stream the text does. The browser
 * shell reads one JSON object per line and never polls.
 *
 * The run itself is `runTurn` from `@smthrs/create-app/worker`, on the host
 * `./host.ts` builds. This file writes the turn into the session: the user
 * message before the run, each card as it streams, and the answer once the
