/**
 * The turn host a session's turns and flow runs execute on.
 *
 * `@smthrs/create-app/worker` owns the run: seat resolution, the judge, the
 * QuickJS sandbox, the in-memory flow engine, and the NDJSON frames. This file
 * only says what differs for this app: the three tool sources a Worker rebinds
 * per run, the fork endpoint the chain tool needs, and the observer that
 * writes a run's cards, cells, and answer back into the session as the run
 * produces them, whether or not anyone is reading the stream.
 *
 * Nothing here is a mock. A missing seat key, judge key, or fork endpoint is a
 * typed 503 refusal decided before any stream opens.
