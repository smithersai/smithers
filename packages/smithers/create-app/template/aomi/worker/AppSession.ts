/**
 * One chat session, as a Durable Object.
 *
 * A session is the app's whole persistent state: the transcript, the cards the
 * agent painted, and the flows it promoted with `flows/write-flow`. All three
 * live in this object's SQLite storage, keyed by nothing. The object *is* the
 * key, so a row here can never belong to another session.
 *
 * The same class also plays a second role. A Durable Object namespace cannot
 * be enumerated, so one well-known object (`registry.ts`, `INDEX_SESSION`)
 * holds the session list `GET /api/session` answers, and every other object
 * writes its own row there as a turn starts and settles. Only the `sessions`
 * table is used in that role; only the other three are used in the session
 * role.
 *
 * The engine journal is deliberately NOT here. `@smthrs/database` has no
 * Durable Object SQLite driver yet (TODO.md), so a turn runs on
 * `FlowEngine.layerMemory` and this object persists the app's own state
 * instead. When the driver lands the journal moves in beside these tables and
 * a resumed turn replays rather than restarts.
