/**
 * The chat flow against a recorded model.
 *
 * `cachedModelTest` replays `./fixtures/answer.json`, so this runs offline,
 * with no provider key, and grades the same model turn on every commit.
 *
 * Re-recording needs a `live` option: a function returning a `Model` bound to
 * a real provider. This template ships none, because a live model pulls in
 * `@smthrs/model` and a credential path that a first app does not need to run
 * its tests. The `aomi` template's `test/support/liveModel.ts` is the worked
 * example. Add one, pass `live`, and `SMTHRS_RECORD=1 vitest run` rewrites this
 * fixture; a recording that fails leaves the committed one alone.
 *
 * The card assertion reads `collectedCards`, not the flow's output. `cards` in
 * the output is the model reporting what it thinks it emitted, and a model that
 * answered in prose can still name a card there. `collectedCards` is the sink
 * `TOOLS.ts` bound, so an entry in it means `ui/pane` actually ran and the pane
 * registry accepted the name. `resetCollectedCards` runs before each test, so
 * the assertion sees only the cards this test's run emitted.
