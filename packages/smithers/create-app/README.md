# @smthrs/create-app

**Documentation:** https://create-app.smithers.sh

Build a web app around Smithers flows. You declare the app once, in a
`PACKAGE.ts` at the app root, and every other name comes from where a file
sits: a page, a pane the model can put on screen, a flow, and the three layer
files that give a flow its model, its compute budget, and its tools. There is
no route table, pane registry, or flow-to-model map to keep in step by hand.

## Install

Install the release-candidate build CLI and authoring surface, then scaffold:

```sh
pnpm add -D @smthrs/build-cli@next @smthrs/targets@next
pnpm exec smithers-build create-app my-app
```

`smithers-build` is the executable of `@smthrs/build-cli`, and `create-app` is
one of its verbs. The scaffold copies a template and substitutes the app name;
its manifest already contains installable RC versions.

## The shortest real example

```sh
pnpm exec smithers-build create-app ledger
cd ledger
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

```text
Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  1 passed (1)
```

That ran the template's `chat` flow through the production agent loop against a
committed model transcript, so the run made no network call and needed no API
key.

## The authoring surface

```ts
// PACKAGE.ts, at the app root
import { CreateApp } from "@smthrs/create-app"

export const App = CreateApp({
  name: "ledger",
  brand: { name: "Ledger", tokens: { accent: "#5288c2" } },
  deploy: { cloudflare: { workerName: "ledger", domain: "ledger.example.com" } }
})
```

`App` carries the manifest plus four targets: `routes` regenerates the route
tables, `dev` serves, `build` bundles, and `deploy` ships the app to a
Cloudflare Worker.

Every other name comes from a file's location:

| File                   | Export    | Constructor       |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| `AGENT.ts`             | `Agent`   | `defineAgent`     |
| `SANDBOX.ts`           | `Sandbox` | `defineSandbox`   |
| `TOOLS.ts`             | `Tools`   | `defineTools`     |
| `flows/<id>/flow.ts`   | `Flow`    | `defineFlow`      |
| `app/panes/<name>.tsx` | `Pane`    | `definePane`      |
| `app/**/page.tsx`      | default   | a React component |
| `app/layout.tsx`       | default   | a React component |

Only the app root's `layout.tsx` is a shell layout. A nested `layout.tsx` is an
ordinary file the router ignores, and a file below `app/panes/` is a page rather
than a pane, so `app/panes/deep/page.tsx` is the page `/panes/deep`.

A layer file applies to its own directory and everything below it. The nearest
ancestor of each kind wins and nothing merges, so `flows/build/AGENT.ts` moves
the build flows to another seat and leaves their sandbox and tools alone. The
app root must provide all three, which is what makes resolution terminate.

A flow never names a model. Its seat comes from the resolved `AGENT.ts`.

## Public API

| Import                         | Runtime                | What it holds                                                                                               |

| `@smthrs/create-app`           | Node                   | Both halves, flat: `CreateApp` plus everything in `./app`.                                                  |
| `@smthrs/create-app/app`       | browser, workerd, Node | The layer, flow, and manifest constructors and types, plus the route-name grammar.                          |
| `@smthrs/create-app/ui`        | browser, workerd, Node | `definePane`, `PaneRegistry`, `PaneContext`, the card schemas, `AppCard`, and `TurnFrame`.                  |
| `@smthrs/create-app/runtime`   | browser, workerd, Node | `materializeFlow`, `layerFor`, `emptyRegistry`, `LayerError`, `SeatProvider`.                               |

| `@smthrs/create-app/router`    | Node                   | `discover`, `render`, `renderUi`, `renderAll`, `writeRoutes`, `resolveLayer`, `RouterError`.                |
| `@smthrs/create-app/vite`      | Node                   | `createApp` (the plugin), `brandCss`, `loadManifest`, `brandModuleId`, `manifestModuleId`.                  |
| `@smthrs/create-app/testing`   | Node                   | `cachedModelTest`, `runCachedModelTest`, `recordModel`, `replayModelError`, `recording`, `preparedRequest`. |
| `@smthrs/create-app/routesBin` | Node                   | `runRoutesBin` and `usage`: the body of the `smithers-routes` executable.                                   |

`./app`, `./ui`, and `./runtime` are what a scaffolded app ships: `routes.gen.ts`
pulls `./app` and `./runtime` into the Worker bundle, `routes.ui.gen.ts` pulls
`./ui` into the browser bundle, and `sideEffects: []` lets a bundler drop the
Node half.

Each subpath is one module, `src/<subpath>.ts`, that holds every export of its
runtime class. This package is exempt from the repository's one-export-per-file
layout for that reason: the imports that decide whether a Worker or a browser
can load a subpath sit at the top of one file. The
[API reference](https://create-app.smithers.sh/reference/api/) lists each
module's exports.

## Generated files

`smithers-routes` writes two files at the app root and never anything else.

- `routes.gen.ts`: every flow with its three resolved layers, plus the pane
  names. No React import, so the Worker and a plain Vitest run both load it.
- `routes.ui.gen.ts`: the layout, the pages, the pane components, and
  `flowSummaries` (each flow's `id`, `file`, and `chat` flag). The browser
  reads its flow list here, never from `routes.gen.ts`.

```sh
smithers-routes           # write; exit 2 on a flag given no value
smithers-routes --check   # write nothing, exit 1 on drift
```

Both templates expose those as `pnpm routes` and `pnpm routes:check`. The Vite
plugin regenerates the tables on start and on every routed file change, so
`pnpm dev` never serves a stale table.

## Testing a flow

`@smthrs/create-app/testing` selects optional peers. The default library
install includes no test runner. Add the testing facade, Node adapter, and
runner before importing this subpath:

```sh
pnpm add -D @smthrs/testing@1.0.0-rc.0 @effect/platform-node@4.0.0-rc.112 vitest@4.1.9
```

```ts
cachedModelTest("chat answers a balance question", {
  fixture: new URL("./fixtures/balance.json", import.meta.url),
  flow: "chat",
  payload: { message: "What is vitalik.eth's balance?" },
  expect: (output) => {
    expect(output.answer).toContain("ETH")
  }
})
```

Replay is the default: no network, no key. `SMTHRS_RECORD=1` records against
the live model the option `live` builds, and rewrites the fixture.

## Templates

The public package ships the `default` template: the smallest app that routes,
runs, tests, and deploys while leaving the agent host to you. The repository's
UI-only Aomi reference stays outside the package until the UI is released.
