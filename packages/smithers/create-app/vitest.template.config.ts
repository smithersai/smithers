/**
 * The shipped templates' own suites, run as a gate of this package.
 *
 * `vitest.config.ts` runs `test/**` alone, because a template is a whole app
 * that installs its own `node_modules`. That left the templates' 104 tests
 * running nowhere: every test for the API's credential check, its body cap,
 * its session-id rule, the settle-once stream wrapper, and the turn wrapper's
 * cancel path lives under `template/aomi/test/`, so an edit to `worker/guard.ts`
 * or `worker/stream.ts` broke nothing any gate ran.
 *
 * The templates are not workspace members and this gate installs nothing, so
 * the aliases below stand in for what a scaffolded app's install resolves:
 *
 * - `@smthrs/create-app/*` is this package, which a scaffold gets from the
 *   registry.
 * - The five `@smthrs/*` packages the template imports that this package does
 *   not itself depend on resolve to their workspace sources. The rest already
 *   resolve through this package's own `node_modules`, and `dedupe` keeps one
 *   `effect` across all of them so Context tags stay identical.
 * - `tevm` resolves to a module whose every export throws
 *   (`test/support/tevmAbsent.ts`). It is an external dependency of the
 *   template alone and no workspace package carries it. Most suites reach the
 *   tool module only through `TOOLS.ts` and `routes.gen.ts`.
 *   `tevm-binding.test.ts` replaces the SDK explicitly to test connection
 *   recovery, endpoint selection, and input decoding without a live chain.
 *
 * `test/tevm.test.ts` is the one file excluded: it drives a real in-memory
 * chain, so it needs the real `tevm` and runs in a scaffolded app.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is typecheck the templates. That needs
 * `@cloudflare/workers-types`, `tevm`, `viem`, `react-dom`, and `@smthrs/ui`
 * resolvable as types, and this checkout installs none of them. A scaffolded
 * app does, and runs it as `pnpm typecheck`.
