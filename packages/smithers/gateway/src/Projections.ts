/**
 * The gateway read path: served projections computed from the control plane.
 *
 * Every projection here is a fold over facts `@smthrs/control` already
 * publishes: `Control.list` for run and flow listings, `Control.watch` for a
 * run's ordered events. The gateway never opens the engine database, so a
 * projection served to a browser through a relay is the same projection a
 * local reader computes, and a projection cannot drift from the control plane
 * by reading a column the control plane does not expose.
 *
 * A snapshot brackets its journal read with run-summary reads and retries
 * when the summary changes. Rows and cursor share the resulting event buffer,
 * so a completion cannot be acknowledged with the preceding run status.
 *
 * A subscription is a snapshot followed by deltas. A delta recomputes the
 * selector's rows from the accumulated events rather than patching them: a
 * projection is a reproducible fold (`@smthrs/journal` `Projection`), and
 * recomputation is the only delta that cannot disagree with a fresh snapshot.
 * `run-events` appends immutable rows. `transcript` normally appends too, but
 * sends an existing snapshot reset when a committed native call fact upgrades
 * previously delivered telemetry. Events accumulate in the stream, so each delta
 * folds without re-reading history. Resuming a historical run summary first
 * rebuilds its compacted health prefix once through durable follow replay.
 *
 * A workspace subscription follows every journal partition without a cursor.
 * The follower stores each retained run's last position and drops replay
 * through that cutoff. Sources and exclusion verdicts share the snapshot's
 * run ceiling; eviction discards a verdict together with its cursor state.
 * Events are gathered for a short window and folded into one frame, and each
 * run's rows are cached so a burst refolds only the runs whose journals grew.
