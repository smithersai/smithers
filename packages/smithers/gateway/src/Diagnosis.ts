/**
 * The run diagnosis: what happened to a run, computed from its own control

 * run rows, node-iteration rows, and attempt rows out of the engine database
 * and optionally asked an agent to narrate them. The rc.0 gateway serves the
 * same answer as a field of the `run-summary` projection, computed from the
 * ordered `ControlEvent` deltas `Control.watch` already publishes. Nothing
 * here opens a database, so a diagnosis read through a relay is the same
 * diagnosis a local reader computes.
 *
 * This is the one fold both surfaces read. `@smthrs/cli` `Forensics` calls
 * `digest` and adds what a terminal card needs on top of it: duplicate calls,
 * per-flow counts, the parked approval payload, and the declined-launch state
 * the wire vocabulary does not carry. The counts, the refusal aggregation, and
 * the clipping are therefore one implementation, not two that drift.

 * Which events may write a run-level field.
 *
 * `uniqueCallEvents` normalizes a native step fact into the `control.agent.*`
 * event the step recorded, so this fold reads two streams at once: the run's
 * own, and one per step a module run dispatched. A step's record carries the
 * `step` object its checkpoint was written under, which is what `callScope`
 * reads; the run's own records carry none. Every run-level field therefore
 * belongs to one of three classes, and a new handler has to name its class
 * before it compiles:
 *
 * - `aggregate`: the field sums or counts what the whole run did, steps
 *   included, so a step's record contributes to it like any other.
 * - `root`: the field is the run's own answer or state, so only an unscoped
 *   record may set it. A step's record is skipped.
 * - scope dependent: the field means something only beside the scope that
 *   recorded it, so it is kept per scope rather than run wide. No field of
 *   this digest is one; `GatewayProjection.callHistory` holds the one that is,
 *   the seat a call ran on.
 *
 * The table, field by field:
 *
 * | Field                           | Class     | Why                                                        |
 * | ------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `turns`                         | aggregate | a turn a step opened is a turn this run opened             |
 * | `seat`                          | aggregate | the seat of the run's last opened turn, wherever it opened |
 * | `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`   | aggregate | a step spends the run's budget, so the run pays for it     |
 * | `calls`, `editsAttempted`       | aggregate | a call a step made is a call this run made                 |
 * | `callsFailed`, `editsSucceeded` | aggregate | the settlement of one of those calls                       |
 * | `refusals`                      | aggregate | the messages those settlements refused with                |
 * | `startedAt`, `endedAt`          | aggregate | a step runs inside the run's span, so its records widen it |
 * | `finalOutput`                   | root      | THE run's answer; a step's answer is the step's            |
 * | `parkedQuestion`                | root      | THE question the run is parked on                          |
 * | `status`, `cause`               | root      | THE run's terminal state, from `control.run.*` alone       |
 *
 * `status`, `cause` and `parkedQuestion` are root only by construction as well
 * as by this class: `StepFact.Fact` accepts an `eventType` matching
 * `^control\.agent\.[a-z-]+$`, so no step fact can normalize to a
