/**
 * The run trace model (factory spec 06, "the run trace": one card shows every
 * run).
 *
 * A run is a recursive program: the agent writes REPL cells in a code
 * container, every `ctx.call` is a durable span, and each turn is a frame. The
 * control journal already records exactly that (`@smthrs/agent` AgentSession
 * journals turn-opened, model-settled, cell-produced, cell-call-started,
 * cell-call-settled, cell-printed, cell-settled, resolved), and the gateway
 * serves it as the `run-events` projection the run card already reads. This
 * module folds those records into a span tree, run → frame → cell → call, and
 * the geometry of one bar per span on a shared time axis. No second data
 * source: what the journal does not carry (realm variables, child runs' own
 * frames) the model does not invent.
 *
 * Pure: the card renders the model, the tests read it from a fixture.
