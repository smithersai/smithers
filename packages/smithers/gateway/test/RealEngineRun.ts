/**
 * A whole gateway whose runs the durable engine really executes.
 *
 * `GatewayStack.ts` composes the control plane under
 * `ControlExecutor.makeNoop()`: a run there is planned, approved, and accepted,
 * and nothing executes it. That is enough to pin the read path's shape and not
 * enough to prove a launch reaches an engine at all.
 *
 * This stack replaces the noop with an executor that hands the launch to the
 * durable engine, in the shape a host composes it:
 *
 * - two databases, because that is what a host runs. `@smthrs/cli`
 *   `NodeControl.databasePath` is the control plane's (`control.db`) and
 *   `NodeControl.executionDatabasePath` is the engine's (`engine.db`), and the
 *   comment on the second says why: each composition owns its own migrations.
 * - the engine executes the flow under `executionId = runId`, the way
 *   `@smthrs/agent` `AgentSession` drives an accepted launch
 *   (`AgentSession.ts:994`). The two databases are what make that id reusable:
 *   the control plane created a `flows_runs` row for the run in ITS database,
 *   and an engine sharing that database would refuse the execution, because
 *   `ensureRun` decodes the existing row as `RunState` and the control plane's
 *   row holds a `RunSummary`.
 * - the terminal control status is written under the run's own fence and
 *   journaled into the CONTROL journal as `control.run.<status>`, which is
 *   what `AgentSession.settle` does and what a client watching the run reads.
 *
 * What this proves, and what it does not: the engine, the journals, the
 * control plane, the projections, and the ordering between them are real, and
 * a run really executes. The flow is a real `@smthrs/flow` `Flow` over a real
 * `Action` rather than an agent flow, because an agent flow needs a provider
 * credential and a suite that needed one would skip in exactly the
 * environments this proof matters in.
 *
 * The engine's own `flows.engine.*` records stay in the engine's journal.
 * {@link EngineRun} exposes them so a suite can assert that, which is the
 * reason `GatewayProjection` folds control records only.
