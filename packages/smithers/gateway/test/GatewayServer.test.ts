/**
 * The assembled HTTP surface, bound to a real loopback socket over a real
 * SQLite control plane.
 *
 * Five of the eight requirements the old `packages/server` suite pinned live
 * here, re-expressed on the rc.0 boundary:
 *
 * - `light-gateway`: `GET /health` answers the workspace identity; an unknown
 *   route is a 404; the bind policy refuses what it must.
 * - `server-resume-lifecycle`: submitting an approval resumes the run it
 *   unblocked, in one call, with no second manual resume.
 * - `index-run-lifecycle-coverage`: a run launched through the served control
 *   plane reaches a terminal status and stays readable there.
 * - `xcombo-child-visibility-gateway`: a child run of a listed parent is
 *   itself listed, and carries the parent it came from.
 * - `serve.startup-recovery`: a gateway whose read path is unavailable still
 *   comes up and still answers `/health`.
 *
 * The keepalive suite pins the release policy item 4 on the socket rather than in
 * the service: a `Watch` a client follows over `/rpc/ws` carries a frame while
 * the run it watches is silent.
