/**
 * Verification: whether a migrated unit is real.
 *
 * Five questions, in the order that makes a failure cheap to read: does it
 * install, is it formatted, does it typecheck, do its tests pass, and does the
 * registry list the flow it was supposed to produce. Discovery is last and it
 * is the one that cannot be argued with — it is the same scan the CLI runs, so
 * a flow discovery will not list is a flow nobody can run.
 *
 * Every command reports rather than throws. A non-zero exit is an answer, and
 * the answer is what the repair round is given: the command line, the exit
 * code, how long it took, and the last 12 KB of each stream.
