/**
 * The migration itself, as one flow over two.
 *
 * The top flow scans, gates, and writes the report. Each unit is a child
 * execution of its own, so the lineage a person reads afterwards has one child
 * per workflow file rather than one long chain nobody can bisect.
 *
 * ## Why the units are in the payload
 *
 * A flow body is plan time: `Node.bindPlanned`'s builder runs once, against a
 * placeholder, before anything executes. A graph therefore cannot fan out over
 * a list the scan step returns at run time — the same constraint
 * `@smthrs/patterns`' `MapReduce` states as "the flow input must be a literal
 * `{ shards }` available while planning". So the unit list is topology and
 * travels in the payload, while the scan still runs inside the flow, is still
 * journaled, and is still what the gate and the report read. A payload whose
 * units disagree with what the in-flow scan found fails the gate rather than
 * migrating a plan the project has outgrown.
 *
 * The unit payload carries the outline, not the captured source: the text a
 * unit is shown has to be the text on disk when that unit starts, and an
 * earlier unit may have rewritten it.

/**
 * Runs the deterministic checks and settles the unit.
 *
 * The order is the point. The rewrite is verified once by the unit flow, then
 * the checks run, then the archive moves the replaced sources aside and
 * rewrites the manifests, and only then is the tree the migration leaves
 * behind. So that final tree is what gets the last word: the postconditions,
 * the whole verification again (install, format, every typecheck, the tests,
 * discovery), the whole-tree confinement check, and the run-state digests all
 * run over it, and the unit is called migrated after they pass and not
 * before. A verification of the tree before the archive would vouch for a
 * tree nobody ends up with.
 *
 * Every fallible operation runs inside one restoring scope: an exception
 * in the initial comparisons, the checks, the archive, or the final verification
 * puts the unit's files back before it propagates. Without it a failing
 * archive would leave a half-moved tree and no report, because the failure
 * escapes the flow and `WriteReport` never runs.
 *
 * The scope restores by re-reading the tree when it fires, so it covers what
 * the archive did as well as what the agent did, and it covers whatever a
 * later version of this function adds below the archive without anyone
 * remembering to extend a list. {@link module:Checkpoint.rollback} is where
 * that is written down.
