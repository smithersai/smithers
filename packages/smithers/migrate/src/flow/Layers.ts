/**
 * The two compositions a migration runs under: a real Node host, and a
 * scripted one for tests.
 *
 * Two filesystems, on purpose. The deterministic half — the scan, the
 * checkpoint, the verification, the archive, the report — reads and writes
 * through Node's own services, because it walks whole trees and the kernel's
 * guarded filesystem costs a helper process per authorized operation. The
 * agent's half runs through the kernel: descriptor-relative access pinned to
 * the project root, a capability envelope that names the project, and a grant
 * store that denies every write under a 0.x run-state path and permits only
 * this project's own verification command lines. Both halves of the promise
 * the tool makes operators are therefore enforced rather than asserted: the
 * kernel refuses a run-state write and refuses a shell command the project
 * does not already run, and the run-state digests fail the unit if the bytes
 * moved anyway.
 *
 * The seat is a role. `AgentAction` declares `migrate`, and the resolver here
 * maps that one name onto whatever the operator asked for with `--seat`. No
 * model id appears anywhere in this package, the prompt's worked pairs
 * included: a host that was given no seat and no key refuses by name, which is
 * the honest failure.
