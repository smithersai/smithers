/**
 * The model-backed step that rewrites one unit, and the host it runs inside.
 *
 * Everything deterministic has already happened by the time this action runs:
 * the project has been scanned, the constructs inventoried, the mapping rows
 * and rewrite snippets chosen, the zod chains and MDX prompts translated where
 * the translation is mechanical, and the unit's own sources captured. What is
 * left is judgment — which of two shapes a `Loop` really is, what a fan-out was
 * for, where a decision belongs in the report — and that is what the agent is
 * asked for.
 *
 * The host it works inside is narrow on purpose. It offers the standard
 * filesystem and shell flows over kernel-guarded services rooted at the
 * project, two flows of this package's own, and a capability envelope that
 * grants the project and nothing else. A write to `.smithers/smithers.db` is
 * refused by the kernel rather than by a sentence in the prompt, and the shell
 * runs this project's own verification commands and nothing else, because a
 * spawned process writes where no filesystem rule can see it.
