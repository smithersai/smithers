/**
 * The checkpoint a unit can be restored to.
 *
 * A migration edits a working copy that already holds work nobody asked this
 * tool to touch, so the checkpoint has two halves and both matter:
 *
 * - A VCS-native handle, recorded in the report so a person can go back with
 *   the tool they already use. On jj it is the change id the working copy sat
 *   on, taken before `jj new` opens a fresh change for the migration, so the
 *   operator's own edits stay in their own change. On git it is
 *   `refs/smithers-migrate/<unit>/<timestamp>`, pointing at the commit
 *   `git stash create` built — a ref, not a stash entry, so the working tree
 *   is never touched and `git stash list` is never disturbed.
 * - A byte-exact copy of the unit's file set under
 *   `<reportDir>/backup/<unit>/`. That is what {@link restore} and
 *   {@link diff} read, because it is the one record that is exact whether or
 *   not a file was tracked, staged, or ignored.
 *
 * A project under no version control refuses, because a migration with no way
 * back is not a migration. `allowNoVcs` accepts the copy alone as the way
 * back.

 * Puts a unit back the way the checkpoint found it, deciding what to put back

 * Never from a set computed earlier. A restore list taken before the
 * deterministic checks and the archive covers only what the agent had done by
 * then, so a failure after the archive — a postcondition, a removal that could
 * not finish, any step a later version adds — would leave the sources in the

 * nothing. The checkpoint's manifest is fixed when the checkpoint is taken, so
 * a diff taken now covers everything the unit did afterwards, archive moves
 * included, and a step nobody has written yet is covered the same way.
 *
 * Three answers, one per kind of change:
 *
 * - Every file the checkpoint recorded goes back byte for byte, whether the
 *   unit edited it, deleted it, or moved it into the archive. The archive copy
 *   of a file that went back is removed with it: an archive is the record of a
 *   migration that happened.
 * - Every path added since is copied beside the checkpoint backup before it is
 *   removed, the unit's own targets included. The caller reports the copy.
 * - A file the unit modified or deleted that the checkpoint never copied is
 *   returned as `unrestored` rather than guessed at. The checkpoint copies the
 *   unit's own files and nothing else, so the honest answer is the path, which
 *   the caller reports with the checkpoint's own restore command.
