 * {@link unitPrompt} is the per-unit task: numbered sources, the inventory and

A workflow is a \`Flow\`. A step is an \`Action\`. A model-backed step is an
\`AgentAction\`. Control flow is \`Node\`. Nothing else is topology.

- \`Flow.make(tag, { payload, success, error, body })\` from \`@smthrs/flow\`
  declares a durable flow. \`body\` is pure and runs at plan time only.
- \`Action.make(tag, { payload, success, error, tier })\` from \`@smthrs/flow\`
  declares a step; \`.toLayer(handler)\` attaches its implementation, and
  \`.call(payload)\` records a plan node. \`tier\` is \`"sealed"\` for a pure
  step, \`"compensable"\` for one with an undo, \`"irreversible"\` otherwise.
- \`AgentAction.make(tag, { payload, output, seat, system, prompt })\` from
  \`@smthrs/agent/AgentAction\` declares a model call. The author never writes
  \`toLayer\`; the implementation ships as \`.layer\`.
- \`Node.bindPlanned\`, \`Node.all\`, \`Node.branch\`, \`Node.map\`, \`Node.catch\`
  from \`@smthrs/plan\` are sequence, fan-out, condition, projection, and
  recovery. Plan width is fixed at plan time: fanning out over something a step
  discovered means ending the round and carrying the list in the next flow's
  payload.
- \`Sleep.action\` and \`DurableClock\` from \`@smthrs/flow\` are durable
  timers. \`WaitFor.action\` over \`DurableDeferred\` is a durable wait.
- \`WithApproval.withApproval\`, \`ReviewLoop.run\`, \`MapReduce.make\`,
  \`Panel.make\`, \`Debate.run\`, \`Escalation.run\`, \`Recursion.recurse\`,
  \`WithRetry.retryEffect\` from \`@smthrs/patterns\` are the higher-order
  patterns. \`RetryPolicy.make\` from \`@smthrs/flow\` is a retry policy.
- \`@smthrs/std\` flows (\`Read\`, \`Write\`, \`Edit\`, \`ApplyPatch\`, \`Ls\`,
  \`Glob\`, \`Grep\`, \`Bash\`) are the host capabilities an agent step calls.
  They are bound by the host, never constructed by application code.
- A seat is a string the host's \`SeatResolver\` turns into a model. A
  declaration carries no API key, no endpoint, and no client.
- Schemas are \`effect/Schema\`, never \`zod\`.

## Layout

One flow per directory: \`flows/<name>/flow.ts\`. The default export is the
\`@smthrs/flow\` flow itself, tag and \`body\` included, so one declaration
carries both the contract the control plane admits and the graph the engine
runs. Write no second declaration for the registry to read: there is one. The
registry discovers a directory by tokenizing \`export default Flow.make(\` and
reads the \`description\` string literal, the \`capabilities\` and the
\`effects\` out of the options object without evaluating the module. A
directory with no \`description\` is discovered with a warning and is not
runnable.`
