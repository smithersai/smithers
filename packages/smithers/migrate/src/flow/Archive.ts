/**
 * Archiving: what happens to a unit's old sources once it verifies, and the
 * deterministic rewrites that run in the same step.
 *
 * A unit's sources fall into two kinds and they get opposite treatment.
 *
 * A source the migration *replaced* — a `.jsx` workflow whose content now
 * lives in `flows/<name>/flow.ts`, a `preload.js` the 1.0 runtime has no use
 * for — moves to `<reportDir>/archive/<original path>`. Deleting it would throw
 * away the only readable record of what the migration was working from; leaving
 * it in place would keep JSX in the typecheck and in the registry's discovery
 * path, which is exactly the "compatibility library" outcome the product rule
 * forbids. Moving it is the only answer that is both auditable and final.
 * `keepOldSources` leaves them where they are for an operator who wants to diff
 * by hand, and the report says so.
 *
 * A source the migration *edits* — `package.json`, a `tsconfig`, `.gitignore` —
 * is never archived. Archiving those would delete the project's manifest and
 * its TypeScript configuration, which is what this module did before the file
 * kinds were told apart. They are rewritten in place instead, by the pure
 * functions below: a dependency edit is deterministic, so no model decides it.
 * The rewrites are a backstop rather than the whole job — the agent is asked to
 * rewrite manifests too — and {@link module:MigrateFlow.postconditions} is what
 * checks the result.
