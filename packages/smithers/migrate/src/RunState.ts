/**
 * Read-only detection of live and persisted Smithers 0.x run state.
 *
 * This module never opens a database in write mode, never runs a migration,
 * never deletes a file, and never connects to Postgres. It reports what is
 * there and hands the operator the instruction that clears it.
 *
 * There is one rule for both non-clean verdicts. `apply` refuses to touch a
 * project whose verdict is `blocked` or `history-only` until the operator
 * passes `--acknowledge-run-state`, and even then the tool writes nothing under
 * any path this module records. `history-only` blocks because a database whose
 * runs have all finished is still 0.x run state: a 1.0 runtime cannot read it,
 * so the operator has to archive or discard it deliberately.
 *
 * A 1.0 runtime cannot resume a 0.x run. That is why the answer is always
 * "finish, archive, or discard it", never "convert it".
