/**
 * The old-construct to new-target mapping table, its class rules, and the
 * rewrite text for the constructs that translate mechanically.
 *
 * Three classes decide how much freedom the migration has:
 *
 * - `automatic`: this module emits the exact rewrite and the agent applies it.
 * - `guided`: the agent rewrites under the listed rule and records a decision.
 * - `unsafe`: the scanner flags it before any edit. `apply` refuses the unit
 *   until the operator names the construct in `--allow-unsafe`, and even then
 *   the agent leaves a `TODO(migrate-smithers-v1)` marker and an `unsupported`
 *   report entry rather than an imitation.
 *
 * A prop can raise a class. `<Parallel>` is automatic, `<Parallel
 * maxConcurrency>` is guided, and `<Task hijack>` is unsafe, because the prop
 * is the part with no counterpart.

 * The rewrite text for one hit, built from the source the inventory captured.

 * or `id`, the schema from the zod chain the `output` prop resolves to, the
 * handler from the element's own children, the step names from the element's
 * own child tasks. The function invents nothing. When a piece it needs was not
 * captured it returns `undefined`, and {@link classifyWithReason} then treats
 * the hit as `guided` so the agent rewrites it under the rule instead.
 *
 * There is no seat literal here and no default model id. A seat appears only
 * when the source names a provider and a model, and `SeatResolver` supplies the
 * rest at run time.
