/**
 * The operator loop, run as an operator runs it.
 *
 * Every command here is a real `smithers` process against one real project
 * directory: a scaffolded flow, `.flows/control.db` and `.flows/engine.db` on
 * disk, and the run rows, journal events, and approval tokens those files
 * actually hold. Nothing is stubbed, and no in-process composition stands in
 * for the executable — the release policy promises are promises about
 * what the binary does, and a handler-level assertion cannot keep them.
 *
 * The one in-process step is the node approval. Registering an in-run approval
 * is what an executing cell's `ask` does (`AgentSession` calls
 * `ControlRuntime.registerApproval` with the ask envelope), and reaching that
 * state through the agent needs a live model seat. Registering it directly
 * against the same SQLite file leaves the durable state identical, so the
 * `approve` verb still crosses a process boundary to decide a token another
 * process wrote.
 *
 * The run every verb below acts on is a MODULE flow, for the same reason: an
 * agent host answers `pending` for one and drives nothing (`AgentSession`
 * "only prompt flows run on the cell harness"), which leaves a durable
 * non-terminal run without a seat, a network call, or a stubbed composition.
 * The scaffolded prompt flow cannot stand in for it: since it carries a
 * `model:` line, launching it either runs a real model or is refused, and a
 * refused launch settles the run `failed` in the launching process.
