/**
 * A nested human wait seen from a host that runs TWO databases.
 *
 * `@smthrs/control` `SqlControlRuntime` can compute a run tree's open human
 * waits itself when it shares a database with the engine. A deployed host does
 * not: `@smthrs/cli` `NativeControl` keeps the control plane's coordination
 * rows in `control.db` and every execution a flow spawns in `engine.db`, and
 * the comment on that composition says why — leaking the engine's stores back
 * would silently redirect `ControlLive` to the wrong database.
 *
 * So on the production coding host the rollup found nothing. Workspace
 * 6f2733a3 had `coding/PreparePlan` parked on `coding-clarification` with its
 * `waiting_request` written and `flows_run_parents` linking it up through
 * three ancestors to `run-1`, all in `engine.db`, while
 * `List {status: "waiting-approval"}` answered `[]`, `List {}` answered
 * `run-1` as `parked` on an `event` with no `pendingWaits`, and the approvals
 * projection had no rows.
 *
 * The one reader of both databases is `ControlExecutor.readExecution`, whose
 * answer `ControlLive.observe` writes over the control plane's own copy. This
 * suite is that topology: two databases, the production observation port, and
 * the gateway read path on top.
