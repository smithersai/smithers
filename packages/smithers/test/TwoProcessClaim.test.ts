/**
 * A second `smithers` over one project root is told when the run is not its.
 *
 * `scripts/repo-contract/fault-gaps.md` row 06 recorded that every local control plane ran as
 * `{hostId: "local", pid: 0}`, so two processes over one project root were one
 * owner to the fence and the loser silently re-drove work the winner held.
 * `engineDurable` now stamps `hostname()` and `process.pid`, and
 * `test/NodeEngine.test.ts` pins that stamp. What that test cannot show is the
 * consequence: whether a SECOND real process, reading the same
 * `.flows/control.db`, is refused.
 *
 * This case drives that at the process boundary. The winner is a real live
 * process on this host whose pid is written onto the run row, exactly as a
 * peer `smithers` leaves it. The loser is the real executable, spawned as an
 * operator spawns it, asked to resume a run it does not own. The promise is
 * "the loser is told it lost, and the row does not move", which only means
 * anything as an exit status and a structured refusal from the public CLI.
 *
 * The row is written rather than raced for a reason. A race needs the winner
 * to still be holding the run when the loser arrives, and rc.0 ships no flow
 * the CLI can execute for a controlled span without a model provider, so a
 * spawned pair would decide the case by whichever process booted first. The
 * arbitration under test is not the race — the store's compare-and-swap
 * already settles that, and `packages/smithers/control` proves it — but what the second
 * process is told about the outcome, and that is what a written row states
 * exactly.
