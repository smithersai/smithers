/**
 * What `smthrs suggest` does when a case injects nothing.
 *
 * `test/Suggest.test.ts` replaces every seam the verb has: the credential
 * reader, the `--json` emitter, and the implementing step. That is what makes
 * its cases a table, and it is also what leaves the defaults behind those
 * seams unexercised — the reader that opens `auth.json`, the emitter that
 * writes to stdout, and the composition that runs the bundled flow on this
 * host. Each of those is a promise the verb makes to an operator who passes
 * no options at all, so each is asserted here through the same public
 * surface, with the seams left where they are.
 *
 * The default implementing step is reached with a seat this machine has no
 * credential for, so the composition is built and the seat is resolved for
 * real and the refusal arrives before any request is signed. Nothing here
 * reaches a model or a network.
