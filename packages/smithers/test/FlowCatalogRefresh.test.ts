/**
 * The agent-led builder loop, on the host a production box composes.
 *
 * A native host builds its executable catalog once, while it starts. Every
 * later plan reads that snapshot, so a flow one of the host's own runs writes
 * into `flows/` had a descriptor and no executable: `flow.plan` answered
 * `FlowNotFound`, the canvas had nothing to draw, and only a restart fixed it.
 * The authoring demo worked anyway because its fixture pre-registered the flow
 * it was about to author, which is a fixture mechanism and not a host.
 *
 * This suite is the host doing it for real, with nothing pre-registered: one
 * `NodeControl.layerControl` over a real registry, a real catalog, the durable
 * control plane and the native engine. A run writes `flows/authored/flow.ts`
 * through the workspace sandbox, the engine journals the copy-back, the
 * observer that bridges those records into the control journal rebuilds that
 * one catalog entry before the receipt is readable, and the next plan is a
 * real plan of the delegate the new file names — which the host then runs.
 *
 * What is real here: the registry, the discovery scan, the module import of
 * the authored bytes, the executable, the control plane, the engine, the
 * sandbox boundary, the diff bundle, the copy-back and the bridge. Nothing is
 * pre-registered on the flow's behalf and no journal record is hand-written.
