/**
 * What the local CLI answers when it finds a run owned by somebody else.
 *
 * `layerExecutor` declares `isAlive: Ownership.sameHostPidProbe`, so the
 * arbitration is a real question about a real process: a `running` row whose
 * lease expired is reclaimed only when the recorded pid is gone from this
 * host's process table. That answer is only observable through the engine's
 * stale-running sweep, so these cases seed rows directly into the execution
 * database and watch what the sweep does with them.
 *
 * The probe can only tell two owners apart when the recorded `hostId` names
 * the machine rather than a constant, which is why `layerExecutor` stamps
 * `hostname()`. The paired case below is what pins that: one row owned by a
 * live pid on this host and one owned by a dead pid on this host go into the
 * same database, and the live one must survive the sweep that reclaims the
 * dead one. Under a constant `hostId` every row read as foreign, the probe
 * declined to answer, and BOTH were stolen.
