/**
 * `smthrs suggest` with its defaults left in place.
 *
 * `test/Suggest.test.ts` asserts the order of the verb and the shape of its
 * three renderings with every seam replaced: a reader for the credential
 * store, an emitter for `--json`, an implementing step, a rendering service.
 * Those doubles are what make the order legible, and they are also what a
 * default is hidden behind: a case that always supplies a reader never learns
 * which file the seat scan opens, and a case that always supplies a step
 * never learns what the verb builds when nobody does.
 *
 * So each case here removes exactly one of those defaults and asserts what
 * the module does on its own — which path the seat scan reads, where a
 * `--json` document goes, what an operator is told when the step the verb
 * built for itself cannot reach the seat they named, and what a reader that
 * fails part-way through turns into.
 *
 * The model is still never reached. The one case that lets the bundled flow
 * run points it at a provider this machine has no key for, so the step fails
 * where a seat is resolved and no request is ever prepared.
