/**
 * The agent-led builder loop on the bridged stack, with nothing pre-registered.
 *
 * A scripted author writes `flows/authoring-demo/flow.ts` through the engine's
 * workspace sandbox; the engine captures the diff bundle and copies it back;
 * the observer that bridges those records into the control journal rebuilds
 * that one catalog entry before the receipt is readable; and the next plan is
 * a real plan of the file's own graph, which the host then runs.
 *
 * What is real: the registry, the discovery scan, the measured module import,
 * the executable, the control plane, the engine, both journals, the sandbox
 * boundary, the diff bundle, the copy-back and the bridge. Nothing is
 * registered on the authored flow's behalf, and no journal record is
 * hand-written (D-081).
