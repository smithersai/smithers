/**
 * What a live plan graph can honestly be built from, proven on a real stack.
 *
 * The flow builder wants six facts: a plan whose nodes have stable ids, node
 * lifecycle that reaches a client, an approval gate on the card, an attempt
 * count for a retried step, a cache verdict on a second run, and a way to join
 * a node's output back to the plan node that produced it. Every assertion below
 * is over `BridgedEngineRun.ts`: a real control plane, a real engine, two
 * SQLite files, and the `EngineJournalSupervisor` bridge a deployed host wires.
 *
 * All six hold. The node lifecycle arrives under the plan's own ids, with the
 * driven graph, its labelled edges and each node's declaration site beside it,
 * and a second run is served the cacheable node from the step cache as soon as
 * the host declares a cache environment; with no environment declared nothing
 * here can address an earlier run's row, so no node is ever `clean`. A node's
 * settlement names the step key digests it dispatched under, which is what
 * joins the attempt records — keyed by digest, carrying no node id — back to
 * the node that drove them, and it carries the engine's own attempt count, so
 * the retried step settles at two. Every assertion is what this stack does, so
 * the UI lanes build only on what passes here.
