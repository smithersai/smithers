/**
 * The gateway read path over a run the engine executes AND reports.
 *
 * `@smthrs/gateway` `test/RealEngineRun.ts` is the nearest stack: a real
 * control plane, a real `@smthrs/flows` `NodeRuntime` engine, two SQLite
 * files. It deliberately omits the bridge between the two journals and its
 * suite asserts that absence, so a client watching one of its runs sees the
 * control lifecycle and none of the engine's own records.
 *
 * A deployed host does wire that bridge. `@smthrs/cli` `NativeControl` builds
 * an `EngineJournalSupervisor` over the engine journal and the control journal
 * and wraps the executor in it, which copies the engine's `flows.engine.*`
 * records into the control journal as `control.engine.event` envelopes. That
 * is the only reason node status can move on a card. This stack is that
 * topology, with a fixture flow chosen so the shapes a graph has to render are
 * all present in one run: a fan-out and a merge, a failure arm, a `HumanTask`
 * gate, an action that fails its first attempt, and a cacheable node.
 *
 * Why it lives in `@smthrs/cli` rather than beside `RealEngineRun.ts`:
 * `EngineJournalSupervisor` is `@smthrs/cli` `src/internal`, which the package
 * blocks from export (`"./internal/*": null`), and `@smthrs/gateway` cannot
 * depend on `@smthrs/cli`, which already depends on it. The supervisor is the
 * subject, so the suite moved to the supervisor.
 *
 * What is real: the control plane, the engine, both journals, both databases,
 * the bridge, the projections, and the ordering between them. Nothing is
 * stubbed below the control plane and no event is hand-journaled. What is not
 * real: the flow is a real `@smthrs/flow` `Flow` over real `Action`s rather
 * than an agent flow, because an agent flow needs a provider credential and a
 * stack that needed one could not run in the environments this proof matters
 * in.
