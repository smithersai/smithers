 * `smthrs doctor` on a local project, straight off the discovery snapshot.

 * with a stub, so nothing executed the function itself. Two promises are worth

 * and warnings alike, and reading it opens no execution database, which is the
 * whole reason local diagnostics take this path instead of `fromControl`.
