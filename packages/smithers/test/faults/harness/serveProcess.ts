/**
 * The served control plane, out of process, and the clients that talk to it.
 *
 * `startServe` runs the product's own `smthrs serve` — the executable
 * `@smthrs/cli` declares as its bin, resolved through Node, not a fixture that
 * re-composes the same layers. That distinction is the whole point of the
 * gateway family: a suite that builds the server itself proves that a
 * composition works, while an operator's complaint is always about the command
 * they typed. Everything the verb decides on the way up — which bind it will
 * accept, which authentication layer it installs, which database file it
 * opens, whether it stays alive — is therefore under test here rather than
 * assumed.
 *
 * `controlClient` builds the shipped `ControlClient` over Node's HTTP and
 * WebSocket transports, the same pair `@smthrs/cli` uses for a `--remote`
 * invocation. The WebSocket constructor is the tracked one from
 * {@link ./dropWebSocket.ts}, so a suite can cut the live socket.
