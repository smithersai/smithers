/**
 * A real run, in a real Jujutsu workspace, parked where time travel can reach
 * it.
 *
 * The time-travel family needs three things the other families do not: a run
 * whose journal has enough frames to scrub through, a workspace whose files
 * change as the run progresses, and a suspended run — `rewind` is a writer, so
 * it takes the ownership claim like any driver and refuses a live run.
 *
 * The flow below produces all three. `Ledger` writes a line to a tracked file
 * through a compensable action, so the engine takes a jj pre-image of the tree
 * before it runs, and then parks on a durable deferred nobody completes.
