/**
 * Case 12 — a rewind puts the workspace back and writes down that it did.
 *
 * The run below writes a line into a jj-tracked file through a compensable
 * action, so the engine takes a pre-image of the tree before the write, and
 * then parks. Rewinding to a frame before the write has to do three things at
 * once: restore the workspace, archive and truncate the journal suffix, and
 * leave an audit row an operator can find afterwards. The file on disk is the
 * assertion that matters — a rewind that only edited rows would leave the
 * workspace lying.
