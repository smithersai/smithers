/**
 * Case 8 — the inspector's projection never falls behind the run.
 *
 * "Never idle" is a claim about a derived view: while the journal has committed
 * frames, the projection folded over them has to keep moving. This case folds
 * the same reducer at every committed frame of a real run and checks the two
 * things that make the view trustworthy — it is monotonic in the frame, and at
 * the last frame it accounts for every attempt the run actually recorded.
 *
 * The projection is `TimeTravel.inspect`, which reads the ordinary engine
 * journal. Nothing here writes `meta.lineageId`: the engine stamps it.
