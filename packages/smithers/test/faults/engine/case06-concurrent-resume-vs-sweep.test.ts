/**
 * Case 6 — two hosts reach for the same abandoned run at once, and only one of
 * them drives it.
 *
 * This is the shape a stale-run sweep and an operator's resume produce together:
 * the run's owner is gone, its claim is free, and two processes decide
 * independently that they should pick it up. The engine's answer is
 * join-or-claim — one takes the claim and the other either joins the result or
 * loses the fence — and the invariant underneath it is that the step runs once
 * more, not twice.
 *
 * Both halves are here, because each can hold while the other breaks. The
 * first test is the engine's: two hosts drive the same parked run and the step
 * dispatches once, which is idempotence. The second is the control plane's:
 * two control planes ask to resume the same suspended run at the same instant
 * and exactly one is admitted, which is the fence. An engine whose attempt
 * rows deduplicate perfectly would pass the first test with no fence at all.
