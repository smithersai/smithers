/**
 * Case 22 — a credential handed to a run never reaches the journal.
 *
 * The run below is deliberately careless: its action logs the token and returns
 * a string with the token inside it, which is how integrations actually leak.
 * `@smthrs/journal`'s redaction is the thing under test, so the assertion reads
 * the SQLite file directly rather than any API that might redact on the way
 * out — a secret that is committed and merely hidden by a getter is still a
 * durable, broadly readable leak.
 *
 * The case has two halves because a credential can surface in two places.
 *
 * The journal is where the leak would be permanent: every committed row is
 * replayed to sync subscribers and to time travel, so redaction happens on the
 * write path and the first test reads what the write path left behind.
 *
 * The operator's terminal is the other place, and the second test reads the
 * child's whole stdout and stderr. release requirements makes case 22 a required
 * release parity test across the journal *and* the logs. That half was RED at
 * rc.0 and stayed in the matrix as a plain failing test rather than as prose,
 * because a matrix that is green while a live credential reaches the terminal
 * reports a truth the product does not have. The redaction
 * deliverable closed it: `@smthrs/journal` `RedactedLogger` puts every log
 * line through the same rules the journal applies on the write path, and
 * `packages/smithers/src/bin.ts` and `packages/smithers/flows/src/NodeRuntime.ts` install
 * it. The assertion that was failing went green with no change to it, which is
 * what a plain failing test is for, and `e2e-faults` became a required CI job.
 * Two assertions were added afterwards, pinning that redaction rewrites the
 * line rather than swallowing it.
 *
 * The journal is not the only table in the file. A third test scans every
 * column of every table the run wrote and fails on any credential outside
 * `executableColumns`. The columns listed there are executable state that
 * resume decodes and re-enters byte for byte: `flows_runs.state_json` holds the
 * run's payload and result, and `flows_attempts.outcome_json` is the copy an
 * action replays instead of executing again. Redacting either would corrupt the
 * resumed run, so they are kept verbatim, and the run's SQLite file
 * (`.flows/*.db`) holds unredacted run inputs and results. Treat it as a secret
 * store; see `@smthrs/run-store` `docs/concepts/durable-values.md`.
 *
 * All three are required gates now. Neither may be marked `.fails`, skipped,
 * or deleted; `scripts/repo-contract/fault-skips.test.mjs` refuses all three
 * and names this file.
