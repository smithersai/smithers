/**
 * A sink that POSTs each alert to one webhook.
 *
 * The body is the alert plus its {@link alertId}, and the same id is sent as
 * an `Idempotency-Key` header, because the package requires the receiver to
 * dedupe on it and a body without it cannot. The header is set after the
 * caller's headers, so it is the one this sink sends.
 *
 * The endpoint must be an absolute `http:` or `https:` URL, checked when the
 * layer is built, and the request is made with redirect following disabled:
 * the caller's headers can carry a credential, and a followed redirect would
 * re-send them to an origin the deployment never named. A 3xx answer is a
 * refusal like any other non-2xx, not a forwarding instruction. The sink owns
 * its Fetch transport; an externally supplied `HttpClient` is not used.
 * Each delivery has its own scope, which aborts the request and releases any
 * unread response body on completion, failure, timeout, or interruption.
 *
 * A non-2xx response is a failure, not a delivery, and an endpoint that never
 * answers is a failure after `timeout`. Paging is exactly the case where a
 * silently dropped request is worse than a retry, and a hung request is worse
 * than either: it is indistinguishable from silence, so it must not be
 * possible to wait on one forever.
