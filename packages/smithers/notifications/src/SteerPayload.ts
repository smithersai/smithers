/**
 * The steering vocabulary carried inside a notification payload.
 *
 * A steer crosses two packages that must not depend on each other. A control
 * plane admits it into the durable queue; a harness drains it at a turn
 * boundary and turns it into a change the model sees. Both depend on this
 * package, so the shape they have to agree on lives here rather than in
 * either of them.
 *
 * The payload is stored as JSON in the journal, which makes decoding the
 * interesting half. A record carrying a `body` string and no `kind` decodes as
 * a message, because that is what a minimal caller means by it: the control
 * plane's steer RPC accepts the same shape. A payload this module cannot
 * classify decodes as nothing at all, because notifications also carry webhook
 * bodies and system events, and rendering one of those as an instruction would
 * put an unrelated payload in front of the model.
