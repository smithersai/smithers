Release candidate scope, host requirements and compatibility review are defined in the [library support policy](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/RELEASE_SUPPORT.md).

`SmithersError` and the five error codes the Smithers integration adapters
raise.

At `1.0.0-rc.0` this package is not on npm. It ships inside the Smithers
repository, where `@smthrs/integrations` is its only consumer; every other
package states its failures as `Schema.TaggedError` classes of its own.

## What it is for

An integration talks to somebody else's API, so its failures have to remain
readable to a human, classifiable by a caller, and safe to write into a log.
`SmithersError` provides stable error fields and stores caller-supplied context
verbatim. It does not redact values. Integration constructors must remove
credentials before constructing it.

- `code` classifies the failure (`INTEGRATION_ERROR`, `TELEGRAM_API_ERROR`, and
  three more).
- `summary` is the message without the appended documentation URL.
- `details` carries caller-supplied context. The top-level record is copied and
  frozen at construction, so adding, removing, or replacing a top-level key on
  the caller's object afterwards cannot change it. Nested values are shared by
  reference and are not deep-frozen, so a caller must not mutate a nested
  record it has attached. Integration constructors must remove credentials
  before attaching the record.
- `cause` is stored verbatim and is not redacted. Callers must redact provider
  text, including bot tokens in URLs and API keys in messages, before attaching
  it. `@smthrs/integrations` exports `redactBotToken` and runs it over Telegram
  provider text before constructing the error.
- `docsUrl` points at the reference page for the code.

```ts
import { isSmithersError, SmithersError } from "@smthrs/errors"

const error = new SmithersError("INVALID_INPUT", "no bot token configured")
error.code // "INVALID_INPUT"
error.message // "no bot token configured See https://smithers.sh/docs/reference/errors"
isSmithersError(error) // true
```

## Codes

`SmithersErrorCode` is derived from the keys of the exported runtime table
`smithersErrorDefinitions`, so the set is closed and an exhaustive `switch`
over `error.code` stays exhaustive. Smithers 0.x carried 180 codes for an
engine that no longer exists; 1.0 keeps the five the integration trees raise.

| Code                         | Raised when                                                                                                                                                                                         | `details`                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INVALID_INPUT`              | An integration helper receives an argument it cannot use: a missing bot token, an approval option key containing a colon, callback data over Telegram's 64-byte limit, or a non-https Mini App URL. | One key naming the offending field, on the raise sites that have a field to name |
| `INTEGRATION_ERROR`          | An integration client, webhook source, or listener reconciliation fails. `reason` classifies the failure so a caller can map it to a transport status.                                              | `{ reason, ...providerSafeDetails }`                                             |
| `TELEGRAM_API_ERROR`         | The Telegram Bot API answers a call with `ok: false`, a non-JSON body, or a transport failure. The bot token is redacted from the message and details.                                              | `{ method, errorCode, description, retryAfterSeconds, deliveredMessageIds }`     |
| `TELEGRAM_INIT_DATA_INVALID` | Telegram Mini App `initData` is empty, expired, missing its hash or signature, or fails HMAC or Ed25519 verification.                                                                               | `{ authDate }` on the freshness failures, otherwise none                         |
| `UNSUPPORTED`                | The runtime lacks a primitive an integration needs, such as Web Crypto or Ed25519 verification.                                                                                                     | none                                                                             |

## Documentation

https://errors.smithers.sh covers the error shape and its redaction contract,
handling a failure from the caller's side, raising one from an adapter,
detecting one across module copies, every code with every raise site, and the
API. The procedure for adding a sixth code is at
https://errors.smithers.sh/guides/add-an-error-code/.
