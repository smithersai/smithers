 * `include` defaults to `src/**\/*.ts`, and findings report at `warning` while
 * the rubric is tuned. Presence of JSDoc is already gated by eslint; this
 * rubric is about truthfulness alone. The call returns a declaration and runs
 * no review; see "Failure contracts" in the package README for declaration
 * and execution failures.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ReviewJsdocAgainstCode } from "@smthrs/repo-targets"
 *
 * const reviewJsdocAgainstCode = ReviewJsdocAgainstCode({ cwd: "packages/smithers/flows/journal" })
