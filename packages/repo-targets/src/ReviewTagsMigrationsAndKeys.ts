/**
 * Reviews changed sources for identity strings, migrations, persisted

 *
 * The rubric is written for a package that persists something: a store, a
 * journal, a cache, or a database driver. `include` defaults to `src/**`,
 * which already contains a `src/migrations` tree, and findings fail the
 * target at `error`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ReviewTagsMigrationsAndKeys } from "@smthrs/repo-targets"
 *
 * const reviewTagsMigrationsAndKeys = ReviewTagsMigrationsAndKeys({ cwd: "packages/smithers/flows/journal" })
 * ```
 *
