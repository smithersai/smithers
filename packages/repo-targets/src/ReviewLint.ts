/**
 * Model-review lint macros, anchored to the package that declares them.
 *
 * One `lint/PACKAGE.ts` once declared these reviews as workspace-wide targets
 * whose `include` list named every covered package by hand, so putting a
 * package under a rubric meant editing a file in a directory that package
 * does not own. Each rubric is a macro here instead: a package's own
 * PACKAGE.ts declares the review it opts into, and the macro supplies the
 * rubric, the prompt framing, the engine, the model tier, the batch size, and
 * the failure threshold.
 *
 * Every glob a macro emits is workspace-rooted. The review matches its
 * `include` patterns against workspace-relative paths that `git diff` listed
 * and expands `context` against the workspace. A PACKAGE.ts writes in a
 * package-relative frame, so the macro resolves each declared pattern against
 * `cwd` and re-roots it. The diff itself is narrowed to the same patterns, so
 * one package's review re-keys on that package's changes alone.
 *
 * This module holds what the rubrics share: the prompt framing, the options,
 * the result type, and the helper that applies one rubric. Each macro lives in
 * its own module beside it.
