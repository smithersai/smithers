/**
 * Reviews changed public APIs against the prose that documents them.
 *
 * `context` defaults to the package's own `README.md` and `docs/*.md` plus the
 * site API reference pages at
 * `//apps/site/src/content/docs/docs/reference/api/<package>*.mdx`, where
 * `<package>` is the last directory in `cwd`. At the workspace root only the
 * local prose is selected. Override `context` to opt into concept or guide
 * sections. Context crosses package boundaries and is read into every batch
 * whether or not it changed; the set must fit LlmLint's 2 MiB aggregate cap.
 * Findings report at `warning` while the rubric is tuned.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ReviewDocsAgainstCode } from "@smthrs/repo-targets"
 *
 * const reviewDocsAgainstCode = ReviewDocsAgainstCode({ cwd: "packages/smithers/flows/journal" })
 * ```
