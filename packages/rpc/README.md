# @smthrs/rpc

`LocalApp` defines harness, repository, file, terminal, and target records. `LocalLsp` defines code intelligence. `CloudTunnel` defines the cloud proxy, terminal tunnel, and sign-in contracts.

Shared product contracts for the local host, browser, and server. Import individual modules such as `@smthrs/rpc/LocalApp`, `@smthrs/rpc/AppLinks`, and `@smthrs/rpc/TargetGraph`.

`LiveTutorial` defines the onboarding tutorial's agent runs: the operations, the run record the app polls, and the route that starts them. `TutorialProviderProxy` defines the closed set of model destinations the tutorial coordinator reaches through the product Worker.

`BrowserFetch` is the one implementation module: the browser tool's guarded fetch-and-extract handler, shared by the product Worker and the local host. It is the only module that performs network I/O, with the DNS resolver injected by each host.

`LocalApp` re-exports the names that moved to `LocalLsp` and `CloudTunnel` for one release. Import them from their home; a new name is exported from its home alone.

The model host owns enrollment (`POST /api/model/credential`) and safe receipts
(`GET /api/model/credential/receipt`). Bun uses its state-scoped OS keychain;
the Worker returns `local_host_required` after its session gate.

## Route ownership

Each route family has one home module, and a route constant is declared only there. A route belongs to the longest family it falls under. Add a route to the module its family names; a new family gets a row here first. `test/RouteOwnership.test.ts` holds every `/api/` constant to this table.

These are public product contracts even while the package is private. Preserve wire fields and route strings when changing implementation details. All exported declarations carry descriptions, `@since`, and `@category`.

Run `pnpm run check`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm run test` here. Sources use the standard NodeNext configuration with unchecked indexed access enabled; an array or dictionary lookup must handle absence. Tests live in `test/` and run under Vitest, matching the other packages. `IndexAccess.types.ts` pins the compiler contract.
