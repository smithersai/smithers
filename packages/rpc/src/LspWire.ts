 * contents become one markdown string cut at the cap; a diagnostic's numeric
 * severity becomes its word. Two adapters speak the wire — the Bun host's
 * stdio session (`apps/ui/src/bun/lsp/LspSession.ts`) and the renderer's
 * cloud client over plue's relay (`apps/ui/src/mainview/state/CloudLspClient.ts`)
 * — and both convert HERE, so a hover reads the same whichever machine the
 * server runs on. Runtime-free: strings and numbers only.
