/**
 * The factory projection: `.smithers/factory.json`, the committed JSON that
 * `//:factoryProjection` writes from `S.Factory({...})` in
 * `.smithers/FACTORY.ts` (Factory design session 2026-09-07 §4; spec 08 §1;
 * RULINGS 21, 23). The public mirror serves it through the contents route
 * that is already allowlisted for signed-out reads, so the Dispatcher card
 * renders the declared rules and the homepage lists the featured flows
 * before anyone signs in.
 *
 * Only the part the app reads is typed here. Field names are the
 * declaration's own: `summary`; `flows`, the flow catalog (one row per
 * discovered flow, featured rows first, each with the `summary` the factory
 * declares under `S.Flow`); `on`, the Dispatcher table; and `github`, the
 * policy pair of RULINGS 23. `on` is a record in the declaration (event key
 * to a flow id or a list of them); the projection flattens it to rows so
 * each row can carry the "Visible as" sentence of design §7 as
 * `description`. A row's `event` is a key of the event vocabulary (spec 08
 * §3): `issue.opened`, `issue.labeled:<label>`, `change.landed`,
 * `github.push:<branch>`, `schedule:<cron>`, `box.session.ended`,
 * `nomination`, `manual`. The declaring side is `@smthrs/targets`
 * `Factory.ts`; a real projection of this repository is pinned against
 * this module in `test/FactoryProjection.test.ts`.
