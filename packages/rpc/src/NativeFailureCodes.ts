/**
 * The native app host's OWN failure taxonomy — the refusals apps/app/src/bun
 * writes on the routes only it serves.
 *
 * This is the THIRD vocabulary. plue's is generated and vendored
 * (PlueFailureCodes.ts); the Cloudflare Worker's is hand-written beside it
 * (WorkerFailureCodes.ts); and the host's private routes — repositories,
 * targets, terminals, code intel, agents — answered `{ error: { code, message } }`
 * with nothing classified at all. Every one of them reached the app as
 * `code: null` with its fault guessed from the status, so `503 node_missing`
 * ("no Node on this box") guessed `infra`, whose copy is "Smithers ran out of
 * infra, yell at @fucory to buy more" — a claim about our fleet made about a
 * laptop that simply has no Node on it.
 *
 * The codes ARE prefixed here, where the Worker's are not. The Worker could
 * keep a gate instead of a prefix because its spellings happened to be free;
 * these are not. Eight of the host's route names are already spelled by plue —
 * `not_found`, `invalid_path`, `invalid_json`, `invalid_request`,
 * `unsupported_media_type`, `language_server_missing`, `not_implemented`,
 * `internal` — and one by the Worker (`method_not_allowed`), and they do not
 * all mean the same thing: plue's `not_implemented` is a `bug` ("the route
 * exists but its implementation does not"), while this host's is a build that
 * does not carry a seam. Renaming the route names instead would break the
 * envelope this host's clients and its docs already read
 * (apps/app/docs/LOCAL-APP.md, `LspClient` matching `language_server_missing`).
 * So a route keeps its bare name inside `error.code`, and the CLASSIFIED code
 * beside it is that name in this namespace: `repo_not_found` is the route's,
 * `native_repo_not_found` is the refusal's.
 *
 * `native_` and not `host_` or `local_`: plue spends `host_` on the machine
 * running a coding guest (`host_lease_lost`), and naming the wrong machine is
 * the mistake `worker_` would have made in WorkerFailureCodes.ts; `local_` is
 * already a route name here (`local_session_required`). The ORIGIN these
 * arrive under is still `local` (Refusal.ts) — the code says which program
 * wrote the refusal, the origin says which machine it ran on.
 *
 * NO row here is `infra`. That fault's copy is about Smithers' own fleet being
 * full, and there is no fleet inside a program on the reader's own box: a host
 * that failed at its own job is a `bug`, a program it needed and could not
 * find or start is a `dependency`, the request or the box's state is `user`,
 * and none of it is fixed by buying more of anything.
 * test/NativeFailureCodes.test.ts holds that line beside the three-way
 * disjointness gate.
