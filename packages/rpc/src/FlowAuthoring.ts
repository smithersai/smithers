/**
 * The flow-authoring pack: the one id the app launches to author a flow, and
 * the stage bodies that pipeline is made of.
 *
 * This module exists because those ids are a contract between two halves that
 * cannot import each other. The app's `/flow.create` door launches
 * {@link FLOW_AUTHORING_ENTRY} through the gateway; the workspace host
 * (`flows/repository/registry.ts`) provisions the same names as built-in
 * bodies on every workspace it serves. When the two drifted apart the door
 * launched `create-workflow`, a name from the 0.x JSX runtime that no 1.0
 * composition has ever registered, and every attempt refused.
 *
 * `flows/` and `apps/app` both read the names from here, so a rename is one
 * edit and a test on either side is testing the id the other side uses.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
