 * Both hosts ask Cloud the same question at sign-in — the Cloudflare Worker in
 * apps/server/src/cloudSession.ts, the desktop app's native host in
 * apps/app/src/bun/CloudAuth.ts — by probing GET /api/user/workspaces with the
 * caller's Cloud PAT. A 403 that means "this token's scopes are short" leaves
 * the person signed in with `scopes: "degraded"`; any other 403 must not.
 * Reading that answer is one rule, so it lives here rather than once per host.
 *
 * The verdict comes off the wire: plue serializes `code` first and clients
 * branch on it, never on `message` (plue pkg/errors/errors.go `APIError`). A
 * body with no plue code — Cloudflare's own block page, another proxy's
 * envelope, a string that merely reads like a scope complaint — cannot publish
 * a signed-in session, whatever English it contains.
 *
 * plue's taxonomy has no code for "this token's scopes are short": the scope
 * gate, the workspaces feature flag, and the repository-bound-token gate all
 * answer `forbidden`, so the code alone cannot separate them and the pinned
 * sentence above picks the scope one out. That is the producer's gap, and
 * fixing it is a change in plue: give `RequireScope` its own registry code
 * (pkg/errors/registry.go) and this function becomes the code test alone.
