/**
 * One shape for every way a request can be refused, across the whole stack.
 *
 * Three parties can refuse an act the app started, and until this file they
 * reached the user as three unrelated kinds of thing: plue answered a coded
 * JSON body, the Cloudflare Worker restated one in its own envelope, and a
 * fetch that never got a response became a bare string with the word "failed"
 * in front of it. Only the first carried any verdict, so the interface (and
 * the chat model) had to read English to find out whose problem it was.
 *
 * A `Refusal` is that verdict, carried: which code, whose FAULT, the server's
 * own words, how long it asked us to wait, the status, and who refused. It is
 * built once at each boundary and then rendered, logged, retried on, and handed
 * to the model without any of those re-deciding what happened.
 *
 * The fault is never guessed from prose. plue states it on the wire; the
 * Worker's pass-through keeps `code` and `retry_after` but not `fault`, so a
 * refusal that reached us through the Worker is classified from the VENDORED
 * registry by its code (PlueFailureCodes.ts); a refusal the Worker wrote
 * ITSELF names a code from its own hand-written registry
 * (WorkerFailureCodes.ts) and is classified from that; a refusal the desktop
 * app's own host wrote on one of ITS private routes names a code from the
 * third registry (NativeFailureCodes.ts); only a refusal carrying none of them
 * falls back to its status, and a fetch that threw is infra by construction —
 * the user's request never reached anyone who could judge it.
 *
 * The three registries are disjoint (test/WorkerFailureCodes.test.ts,
 * test/NativeFailureCodes.test.ts) — the Worker's by gate, the host's by gate
 * and by its `native_` namespace, which it needs because eight of its route
 * names are spelled by plue — so one lookup of the string on the wire answers
 * both which code it is and who wrote it.
