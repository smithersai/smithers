/**
 * The Cloudflare Worker's OWN failure taxonomy — the refusals apps/server
 * writes itself rather than passing through from plue.
 *
 * HAND-WRITTEN, and deliberately a separate file from PlueFailureCodes.ts:
 * that one is generated from plue's `docs/failure-codes.json` and must stay
 * byte-identical to its source, so a code of ours must never be added to it.
 * This is the other half of the same vocabulary — same three facts per row
 * (`fault`, `status`, `retryAfter`), same meaning of each — written by us for
 * the party plue knows nothing about.
 *
 * About a third of what a person sees refused never reaches plue at all. The
 * Worker answers it: the session is not signed in, the route does not exist,
 * the body is past the ceiling, the deployment is missing a secret a seam
 * needs, an upstream never answered. Until this table those were PROSE, so the
 * app could not tell "you are signed out" from "this deployment is
 * misconfigured" without matching English — and the second one is an INFRA
 * failure whose audience is whoever deployed it, not the person reading it.
 *
 * The codes are NOT prefixed. Two of them (`turn_rate_limited`,
 * `gateway_proxy_removed`) are already on the wire and matched by the app and
 * by the launch probes, so they keep their spelling; and plue's own registry
 * already spends the word `worker_` on ITS sandbox workers
 * (`worker_draining`, `worker_fenced`), so a `worker_` prefix here would name
 * the wrong machine. What keeps the two vocabularies apart is a gate instead
 * of a prefix: WorkerFailureCodes.test.ts fails if any code appears in both
 * tables, which is also the alarm for a code plue adds later that collides
 * with one of ours.
