/**
 * The mythical stack of one repository, as the monitoring UI reads it.
 *
 * A repository's `mythical` bookmark is one linear stack of logical changes.
 * Every open GitHub issue becomes an item: the stack service admits it (or
 * skips it with a reason), a lane (one Plue workspace) plans it against the
 * stack tip and implements it, the service integrates the result onto the
 * current tip, verifies rebased candidates, and proposes it to GitHub as a
 * pull request whose content is exactly a verified stack state. `main` is
 * append-only; merged pull requests are folded back into the stack.
 *
 * `GET /api/repos/{owner}/{repo}/mythical` answers {@link MythicalStackSchema}.
 * `GET …/mythical/events` is a server-sent event stream whose `mythical`
 * events ({@link MythicalEventSchema}) are hints: a client re-reads the
 * snapshot on every event, and the snapshot is authoritative. The write
 * routes acknowledge immediately; the stack worker does the work, so a
 * `202` is "requested", never "done".
 *
 * Wire fields are camelCase and match these schemas exactly. The design is
 * the mythical workstream's design document (epic smithersai/smithers#1745).
