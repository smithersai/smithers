/**
 * What the app SAYS about a refusal, in one table, keyed by whose fault it is.
 *
 * The refusing party's own words are never rewritten — the workspace card's
 * standing rule is "plue's own words, verbatim", and they still render
 * underneath. What this file adds is the one sentence those words cannot
 * carry: whose problem this is. "service unavailable" reads identically
 * whether the caller asked for something they may not have, whether the thing
 * simply is not ready yet, or whether Smithers' own fleet is full — and a
 * person cannot act on it, or stop blaming themselves for it, until somebody
 * says which.
 *
 * Three consumers, one row: `lead` is the line the interface puts above the
 * server's words, `agent` is the sentence the chat model is handed with the
 * tool result so it states the fault class instead of inferring it from prose,
 * and `doors` is which ways out the surface offers.
 *
 * The table is keyed by fault and overridden per code, not written per code:
 * there are a hundred-odd codes and five faults, and the fault is the part a
 * person acts
 * on. `satisfies Record<PlueFault, RefusalCopyRow>` means a fault plue adds
 * has no copy until somebody writes it, which is a compile error rather than a
 * blank line in front of a user.
 *
 * `infra` is where that stops being enough, and every one of its codes has a
 * written row below. The fault says whose problem it is, which is true of all
 * of them; it does not say WHAT went wrong, and infra failures differ there
 * more than any other fault does. A fleet with no free slots, a deployment
 * nobody migrated, a box on last month's image and a component that is not
 * answering are one fault and four different sentences — and for a long time
 * they shared the first one, so a reader whose wiki backend was down was told
 * Smithers had run out of infra and that somebody should buy more of it.
 * Nothing was full. The fault's own lead is now the vague-but-true line a new
 * code inherits until somebody writes its row.
 *
 * The Cloudflare Worker's OWN refusals go further and REQUIRE a written lead
 * (WORKER_REFUSAL_COPY below), because there is no registry doc behind them to
 * write one from later.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
