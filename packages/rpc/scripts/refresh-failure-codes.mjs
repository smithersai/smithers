 * Refresh the TypeScript copy of Smithers' failure-code registry.

 *
 * Smithers Go owns the taxonomy in packages/backend/internal/pkg/errors.
 * Its checked-in document is docs/api/failure-codes.json, and
 * GET /api/meta/failure-codes serves the same bytes. This script copies the
 * document into src/plue-failure-codes.json UNCHANGED and regenerates
 * src/PlueFailureCodes.ts from them, which is where the codes become types.
 *
 * Run it in the same change that edits the Go registry. Without the
 * regeneration a new code has no row, and `satisfies Record<PlueFailureCode,
 * PlueFailureEntry>` in the generated file makes that a compile error rather
 * than a refusal the app renders as a shrug. `--check` fails instead of
 * writing, which is what the drift test and CI want.
