// refusal by reading only the first 240 bytes of the upstream body. Go's
// encoding/json emits struct fields in declaration order, so the order below
// IS the wire order: adding a field before Message, or moving Message up,
// silently breaks that classifier. TestErrorBodyPutsVerdictFirst pins it.
